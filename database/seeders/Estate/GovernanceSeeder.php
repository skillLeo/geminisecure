/**
 * The estate's own elections and its meeting register — boards 9, 10, 11, 12, 36.
 *
 * HOW THE RECEIPTS AND THE MARKS ARE KEPT UNLINKABLE
 * ==================================================
 *
 * This is the one thing in this file that is not a matter of taste, so it is
 * first. Platform invariant 3: turnout is provable and how a household voted is
 * not recoverable — not by the secretary, not by platform staff, not by a
 * database administrator with the whole estate in front of them.
 *
 * THE SEEDER NEVER FORMS THE PAIRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. It does not build 318
 * ballot papers and then write them out; it builds TWO INDEPENDENT STRUCTURES
 * that are never joined even in memory:
 *
 *   the electorate   which households voted — a list of unit ids, chosen per
 *                    phase so board 11's five turnout bars come out.
 *
 *   the count        what the 318 papers chose, IN AGGREGATE — one row per mark,
 *                    generated from the per-option totals board 11 prints.
 *
 * There is no third structure tying a unit to an option, and no loop that ever
 * holds both a unit and a mark at the same time. `Governance::castVote()` writes
 * one household's paper at a time because a resident casting a vote necessarily
 * knows their own choice; a seeder has no such excuse, and the aggregate is all
 * the boards ever draw.
 *
 * FOUR CORRELATIONS ARE REFUSED, EACH DELIBERATELY:
 *
 *   row order        Both arrays are shuffled before insert, SEPARATELY. The
 *                    receipts go in in one random order and the marks in
 *                    another, so the nth row of one is nothing to do with the
 *                    nth row of the other.
 *
 *   id order         `ballot_receipts.id` is an auto-increment and `mark_id` is
 *                    128 bits from `random_bytes`. Sorting the marks by their
 *                    key sorts them by nothing. There is also no arithmetic
 *                    relation between the two counts: 318 receipts against 1,670
 *                    marks, because a three-seat race takes three marks off one
 *                    paper.
 *
 *   clock            `ballot_marks` has no temporal column at all — the
 *                    migration refuses one — and `voted_on` here is a DATE
 *                    spread across the polling week. Even if a clock appeared on
 *                    the marks tomorrow, a date is too coarse to pair with it.
 *
 *   payload          Nothing on a mark names a household, a unit, a resident or
 *                    a phase. The only column beside the random key is the
 *                    option, and an option reaches its ballot through the paper.
 *
 * WHAT IS TRUE IS TRUE ONLY AS A TOTAL: 318 receipts and 318 Chairman marks
 * agree because every household that voted marked one Chairman, and that is the
 * whole of the relationship. Nothing finer is recoverable, and nothing finer was
 * ever computed.
 *
 * BOTH TABLES ARE APPEND-ONLY AT THE DATABASE (see ApplyAppendOnlyGrants), so a
 * re-run cannot correct a half-written poll row by row — deleting marks one at a
 * time is itself the de-anonymising attack the grant exists to stop. When the
 * poll on disk does not match the poll this file describes, it is TRUNCATED
 * whole, through the schema owner, exactly as `EstateFinanceSeeder::resetLedger`
 * does and under the same local-and-testing-only guard.
 *
 * THE ELECTION IS SEEDED AT TWO MOMENTS, BECAUSE ITS BOARDS DRAW TWO
 * =================================================================
 *
 * Board 9 draws the 2026 election at "Nominations Open" with three days left to
 * run. Board 11 draws the same election at "Tally", voted and awaiting
 * certification. One ballot cannot be at both, and neither board is wrong: an
 * election is a year's worth of PAPERS, and board 9's own subtitle says there
 * are two of them.
 *
 * So Ballot A (Community Executive) has run its course — nominations closed,
 * candidates vetted, poll opened and shut, 318 papers counted — and sits at
 * Tally. Ballot B (Phase Leadership) opened its nominations later and is still
 * taking them. `Governance::leadBallot()` was built for exactly this: the
 * control room speaks for the LEAST advanced paper, so board 9's badge reads
 * "Nominations Open", and the results screen speaks for the most advanced, so
 * board 11 has a tally to draw.
 *
 * IT ALSO PUTS BOTH OFFICERS' CONTROLS IN REACH, which is the standing ruling on
 * this module. The Secretary RUNS an election, and Ballot B gives them a live
 * "Close nominations early" and five nominations to vet. The President and Vice
 * President CERTIFY one, and Ballot A gives them a tally to certify that nobody
 * else may. Seeding a single paper would have left one of those two roles with a
 * screen full of controls that refuse.
 *
 * EVERY DATE IS AN OFFSET FROM TODAY. Board 9's "3 days until nominations close"
 * and board 36's split between two upcoming meetings and three held ones are
 * arithmetic against the day the screen is drawn, not against September 2026. A
 * meeting seeded on a fixed date reads as "held" a fortnight later and the
 * register silently loses its two upcoming rows. `FacilitiesSeeder` places its
 * tickets the same way and for the same reason.
 *
 * CONTENT RESIDUALS, recorded rather than resolved by invention. See D-051.
 *
 *   - Board 11's five phase bars (80/65/74/58/69) and its "318 of 450" headline
 *     cannot both be true of 92, 104, 88, 96 and 70 units: the bars add to 311.
 *     The headline wins, because it also drives the turnout percentage and all
 *     four vote shares on the same screen — 187/318 is 59% and 187/311 is 60%.
 *     The bars come out within two points of the board's.
 *
 *   - Board 10 draws Michelle Palmer's nomination as "Pending review" and board
 *     11 gives her 201 votes and a Vice Chairman seat. A candidate cannot be on
 *     a paper nobody vetted, so hers is seeded approved. Keith Walters is the
 *     pending one the board's own arithmetic allows: board 9 counts three
 *     Chairman nominations and board 11 draws two Chairman candidates.
 *
 *   - Board 10 places Sonia Campbell at "Phase 4 · Lot 88" and Keith Walters at
 *     "Phase 2 · Lot 63"; the estate's map puts both lots in Phase 1. Board 4
 *     puts two different households at Lot 12, in two different phases, so the
 *     boards' phase labels cannot all be true of one estate. The UNIT wins —
 *     `Governance::nominationsBoard()` reads the phase off the property, because
 *     one estate has one map.
 *
 *   - Board 10 rejects Ricardo Hall for "arrears >90 days" and boards 5 and 6
 *     put Lot 9 in the 60-day bucket owing J$18,600. The reason is stored
 *     verbatim — it is the returning officer's recorded decision, not a computed
 *     value — and the eligibility snapshot written beside it is the ageing the
 *     ledger actually reports on the day the decision was taken. D-042 already
 *     rules that the sub-ledger wins.
 *
 *   - Board 36 dates the AGM "Sat, Sep 27" and the phase meeting "Sat, Oct 4";
 *     both fall on a Sunday. The DATES are seeded and the weekday is derived, so
 *     the screen is never internally wrong.
