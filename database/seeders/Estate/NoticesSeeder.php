/**
 * Board 32's three notices, and enough read receipts to reproduce its bars.
 *
 * THE SEEN PERCENTAGES ARE NOT SEEDED, THE RECEIPTS ARE. Board 32 draws 47%,
 * 71% and 88%, and `Notices::board()` computes each as receipts over the size of
 * the audience. So this seeder writes the RECEIPTS — the right number of
 * residents having read each notice — and the bars come out on their own. Storing
 * the percentage would make the screen agree with the board while proving
 * nothing about the arithmetic behind it, which is the whole reason that figure
 * is on the screen.
 *
 * The counts are therefore derived from the audience rather than fixed: 47% of
 * whatever Phase 2's roll is today, not a hardcoded 212. An estate that grows
 * still draws 47%.
 *
 * TWO BYLINES, TWO SHAPES, AND THE BOARD IS RIGHT ABOUT BOTH. Its first notice
 * reads "Posted by Property Manager" and its other two name people. A gate
 * closure belongs to the OFFICE — whoever manages the estate next month owns it
 * too — while an AGM notice is signed by the Secretary personally. The author is
 * recorded on all three either way; `posted_as_role` only changes what is shown.
 *
 * DATES ARE OFFSETS FROM TODAY, not the board's literals. Board 32 posts its
 * newest notice on "Sep 4, 8:15 AM" and this estate is seeded whenever the
 * command runs; a notice fixed to a date in September 2026 would read as months
 * old by the time anybody opened the screen, and the list sorts newest first.
 *
 * The offsets are the BOARD'S OWN — six, nine and twelve days before the day it
 * was drawn — so an estate seeded that day reproduces Sep 4, Sep 1 and Aug 29
 * exactly, and one seeded later keeps the same three-day spacing running back
 * from whenever it was.
