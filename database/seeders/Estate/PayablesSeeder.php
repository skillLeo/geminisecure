/**
 * Phoenix Park's suppliers, its open bills and last month's bank statement —
 * boards 26, 27, 28 and 39.
 *
 * THE FIGURE EVERYTHING HANGS ON IS J$121,690. Board 27's four open bills —
 * J$8,500 + J$12,000 + J$6,890 + J$94,300 — are also board 27's "Total payable"
 * tile, also board 25's balance for 2000 Accounts Payable, and also board 25's
 * "Bills payable" KPI. Four screens, one number, and it is only one number
 * because every bill here posts through `Payables` and every one of those totals
 * is the same journal lines read back. The settled Gate2 bill is correctly
 * outside it: it was paid, so its credit to 2000 has a debit against it.
 *
 * IT IS IDEMPOTENT AND IT HAS TO BE. Journals are append-only. A seeder that
 * re-approved these five bills on a second run would double the estate's
 * liabilities with no way back — so every bill is checked for before it is
 * recorded, and the reconciliation is written once or not at all.
 *
 * ASSUMPTION: the TRNs are invented. No board draws one, and every vendor needs
 * one on file or none of these bills could be paid at all — which is the rule
 * `Payables::pay()` enforces and the reason the column exists.
 *
 * CONTENT RESIDUAL — board 28 draws three of its five statement lines as already
 * matched, and none of the three can be matched here. A maintenance-fee deposit
 * of exactly J$612,400, a prior Island Electric invoice and a staff payroll batch
 * are entries this estate does not have: the first would have to replace the dues
 * receipts the arrears fit already posted, the second is a bill nobody drew in
 * full, and the third is board 30's. Matching a statement line to an entry that
 * does not exist — or to one for a different amount — is exactly the false tie a
 * reconciliation exists to prevent, so all five lines are seeded as the statement
 * itself reads and the matching is left to be done on the screen.
