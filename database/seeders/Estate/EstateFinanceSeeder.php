/**
 * Phoenix Park's estate: 450 units, 441 households, and six months of dues.
 *
 * Runs INSIDE tenancy. Every row is written to one estate's own database.
 *
 * WHY IT IS THIS BIG. Board 2 states 450 units and 441 occupied; board 5 states
 * J$1,840,000 of arrears split four ways by age; board 2 splits the same total
 * five ways by phase; boards 5 and 6 name five specific units and what each
 * owes. Seeding four households would leave every one of those figures
 * unreachable, and the screens that exist to show them unreviewable.
 *
 * EVERY BALANCE COMES FROM POSTED JOURNAL ENTRIES. Nothing here writes a
 * balance. Dues are billed as a monthly run — one entry, one credit to income,
 * a debit line per unit — and receipts are banked in batches the same way, so
 * the arrears on every screen are the ledger read back rather than a number
 * kept beside it.
 *
 * THE FIT IS SOLVED, NOT HAND-WRITTEN. `ArrearsPlan` works out which units make
 * up the difference and proves both margins land exactly before a row is
 * written. See its docblock for the constraints.
