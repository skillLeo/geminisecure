/**
 * Phoenix Park's maintenance queue and its booking diary — boards 17 to 20.
 *
 * IT RUNS BEFORE `PayablesSeeder` AND IT HAS TO. Board 27's bills are recorded
 * against tickets #1042, #1041, #1037 and #1031 by number, and `bills.ticket_id`
 * is now a foreign key to `maintenance_tickets.number` — so the tickets have to
 * exist before the bills that name them. The supplier register is the payables
 * seeder's, and this one calls that step directly rather than keeping a second
 * copy of five TRNs.
 *
 * IT POSTS NOTHING TO THE LEDGER, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. An amenity fee that is
 * charged goes through `Dues::charge` like any other charge — but charging these
 * four seeded bookings would add J$17,500 to a receivable that boards 2, 5, 6
 * and 25 all state as J$1,840,000, and would break `EstateFinanceSeeder`'s own
 * idempotency guard, which recognises a finished estate by that figure. Board 19
 * draws no fee state against a booking either; its only money column is the
 * deposit. So the diary is seeded as the board draws it and the charging path is
 * exercised where it belongs, in `EstateMaintenanceTest`.
 *
 * WHY THERE ARE SEVENTEEN TICKETS AND THE BOARD DRAWS FIVE. Board 17's tiles say
 * 12 open, 7 in progress, 2 overdue and 3.2 days average resolution, and every
 * one of those is DERIVED — the brief says so, and the five rows drawn cannot
 * reach any of them. Seeding only the drawn five would leave four figures on a
 * reviewed screen unreachable, which is the same argument that makes the estate
 * 450 units rather than four. The twelve extra tickets are numbered BELOW 1031
 * so that the queue, sorted descending by number as the board sorts it, still
 * opens with exactly the five rows the board draws.
 *
 * THE DATES ARE RELATIVE AND THE BOARD'S ARE ABSOLUTE. An age of "2 days" and a
 * status of "Overdue" are the load-bearing figures on board 17, and both are
 * arithmetic against today — a ticket seeded on a fixed date in September 2026
 * would read as months overdue by the time anybody opened the screen. So each
 * ticket is placed by its distance from today, chosen to reproduce the board's
 * own ages, and the drawn literal dates ("Closed Sep 2") follow from that rather
 * than being written down. Board 19's bookings are placed the same way, at the
 * offsets that reproduce Sep 20, 21 and 27 when this is seeded in early
 * September.
 *
 * CONTENT RESIDUALS, recorded rather than resolved by invention:
 *   - Board 17 writes "Gate2_Contractor Ltd" with an underscore and board 26
 *     registers the same supplier as "Gate2 Contractor Ltd". The register wins;
 *     one estate cannot have two of the same vendor.
 *   - Board 19 dates three bookings "Sat, Sep 20", "Sun, Sep 21" and "Sat, Sep
 *     27". Those weekdays cannot all be true of one calendar. The DATES are
 *     seeded and the weekday is derived, so the screen is never internally
 *     wrong.
 *   - The Build Spec names a cancellation rule and a booking window on every
 *     amenity and board 20 draws neither. Both are left unset rather than
 *     invented; the columns exist because a booking snapshots the cancellation
 *     rule, and an estate sets it on the edit screen.
