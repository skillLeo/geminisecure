/**
 * Phoenix Park's phase structure, its named households and the three unit claims
 * waiting on somebody — boards 3, 4, 31 and 38.
 *
 * IT EXTENDS THE ESTATE AND NEVER REBUILDS IT. `EstateFinanceSeeder` has already
 * laid out 450 units across five phases, put 433 households in them and posted
 * six months of dues against every one — J$1,840,000 of arrears in four specific
 * ageing buckets, which is how that seeder recognises a finished estate. Nothing
 * here creates a unit, deletes one, or writes a single journal line. It renames
 * six households the boards name, adds the members the boards count, records
 * three claims and writes the five phase rows.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT PLACE PEOPLE WHERE BOARD 4 PUTS THEM, EXACTLY. Board 4 gives
 * six households a phase and a lot, and three of those pairings are not
 * reproducible in this estate:
 *
 *   - Sonia Campbell is drawn at "Phase 4 · Lot 88" and Keith Walters at
 *     "Phase 2 · Lot 63". The estate's arrears fit places Lot 88 and Lot 63 in
 *     Phase 1, and the fit cannot be moved: it is what makes both the per-phase
 *     and the per-ageing totals land on the figures three boards state.
 *
 *   - Natalie Wong is drawn at "Phase 2 · Lot 12" and Dwayne Robinson at
 *     "Phase 1 · Lot 12". `units.reference` is unique, so one estate has one
 *     Lot 12 — and board 4's own note says lot numbers repeat across phases,
 *     which this schema does not model and cannot without renumbering 450 units
 *     under a ledger that has no delete.
 *
 * THE LOT WINS OVER THE PHASE, and the reason is board 19. The facilities seeder
 * has already booked the Gazebo for "Andrea Fletcher — Lot 47", the Club House
 * for "Sonia Campbell — Lot 88" and the Community Centre for "Keith Walters —
 * Lot 63", and raised ticket #1042 against Lot 47. An estate cannot have two
 * Sonia Campbells at two different addresses, so each named household is placed
 * at the LOT the boards give it and takes whichever phase this estate puts that
 * lot in. Natalie Wong, whose lot is taken, goes to the first unnamed occupied
 * unit in the phase she is drawn in. Every departure is recorded in DECISIONS.md
 * rather than resolved by moving a unit.
 *
 * AND THE BALANCES ARE THE LEDGER'S, NOT THE BOARD'S. Board 4 draws $12,400, $0,
 * $6,200, $0, $6,200 and $0 down its Balance column. Lot 47 is exactly J$12,400
 * because the arrears fit put it there; the other five are whatever their unit
 * ledgers actually say, because a residents screen showing a figure the accounts
 * disagree with is the failure this whole module is built to avoid. Nothing here
 * bills or receipts anything to make a column match.
 *
 * NOBODY IS RESTRICTED. `access_restricted` is left exactly as the estate seeder
 * left it — false on all 433 households — because nothing in this system
 * auto-restricts on arrears yet and restriction is an act with a notice period
 * behind it (D-024). `EstateResidentsTest` restricts a household of its own to
 * prove the screens withhold the figure.
