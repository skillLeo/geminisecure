/**
 * The estate's own settings row — boards 21 and 23.
 *
 * SMALL ON PURPOSE, AND MOST OF WHAT THESE SCREENS DRAW IS NOT SEEDED HERE
 * BECAUSE IT IS NOT SEEDED ANYWHERE:
 *
 *   board 21  the estate name, address, unit count and phase count are the
 *             central client record and this estate's own units. Seeding a
 *             second copy is precisely what the migration refuses to hold a
 *             column for
 *   board 22  users, roles and assignments are central and belong to
 *             DemoDataSeeder
 *   board 23  the feature catalogue is central and belongs to
 *             PlatformCatalogueSeeder
 *   board 24  the matrix is central and belongs to RbacMatrixSeeder
 *
 * NO `estate_features` ROW IS WRITTEN, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. A row in
 * that table means somebody in this community made a decision; board 23 draws
 * every switch on because Phoenix Park is on the Premium plan and Premium
 * includes everything, which is the PLAN's answer and not the estate's.
 * Seeding eleven rows saying "enabled" would put eleven decisions nobody made
 * into the record, and the day the plan changed they would outvote it.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT, AND WRITE-ONCE ON EVERY FIELD IT TOUCHES. The contact details
 * below are seeded only where the estate has none. A seeder that reset them on
 * every run would quietly undo a committee correcting its own enquiries
 * address — the same rule PayablesSeeder applies to a vendor's TRN, and for the
 * same reason: a seed is a starting point, not a periodic instruction.
