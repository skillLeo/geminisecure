/**
 * The estate's own four staff, five months of runs, and the returns — boards
 * 13, 14, 15, 16 and 37.
 *
 * THE PAYE FIGURES ARE NOT THE BOARD'S, AND THAT IS THE ONE THING TO READ
 * BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HERE.
 *
 * Board 15 draws six money columns per employee. Five of them — gross, NIS,
 * NHT, Education Tax and the deduction total's arithmetic — this seeder
 * reproduces to the cent, because the rate card the board was drawn against and
 * the rate version seeded on this platform agree exactly: 3% NIS, 2% NHT, 2.25%
 * Education Tax on gross-less-NIS. The sixth, PAYE, does not, and the gap is
 * large enough that seeding the board's own figures would have made this
 * application withhold the wrong tax from four people:
 *
 *     Patricia Morgan   board 42,928   lawful 5,230
 *     Neil Anderson     board 22,044   lawful 0
 *     Wayne Thomas      board 20,420   lawful 0
 *     Simone Clarke     board      0   lawful 0
 *
 * The board's column is 25% of (gross − NIS − NHT − Education Tax), charged on
 * the WHOLE and nil below a cliff, and that one rule reproduces all four — the
 * fourth is not an exception to it, she is under the cliff. Two things are
 * wrong with it and they compound. PAYE is charged on statutory income, which
 * is gross less NIS only — NHT and Education Tax are not deductible against it
 * — and it is charged on the EXCESS above the threshold, not on the whole once
 * the threshold is passed.
 *
 * WHERE THE BOARD'S CLIFF SAT, IDENTIFIED BY THE RULING RATHER THAN BY THE
 * BOARD. Thomas is charged on a base of 81,679.40 and Clarke is not charged on
 * 66,828.60, so the cliff lay between them — and four divisors of the annual
 * threshold landed in that window, so four observations could not say which.
 * The ruling did: the board applied TAJ's published FORTNIGHTLY threshold for
 * 2026, 73,234.90, to monthly pay. That is not the annual figure divided by any
 * whole number, which is exactly why this was reported as narrowed rather than
 * identified (D-073) — and why the ÷26 reading that looked natural was wrong.
 *
 * So this seeder uses `PayrollCalculator`, which implements the real rule and
 * whose order is load-bearing — see its docblock. The estate's own screens then
 * show the lawful figures and board 15's PAYE and Net columns differ from them.
 * That is recorded as a residual rather than resolved by reshaping the
 * calculation: an application that withholds J$85,392 a month where the ruling
 * asks J$5,230 is not a fidelity success. See DECISIONS.md D-061 and D-082 and
 * QUESTIONS.md Q-002 — ruled: PAYE is 25% of the amount above the threshold, a
 * band on the excess, and this calculator had it right.
 *
 * THE MONEY RATHER THAN A MULTIPLE, because two multiples can be read off these
 * figures and they are easy to swap. Morgan's own column overstates by 8.2x; the
 * RUN overstates by 16.3x, larger only because the other three are charged tax
 * they do not owe at all. Before the ruling set the real threshold the same
 * comparison read 5.8x and 11.6x. Neither multiple belongs in a sentence on its
 * own; J$80,162 a month does.
 *
 * WHAT IS POSTED AND WHAT IS NOT. The three finished months post through
 * `Ledger::post()` exactly as a bill does, and the two live ones do not: the
 * September run is still stuck on its exceptions and the August run is
 * calculated and waiting for a second approver, which is the state board 15
 * exists to draw. Nothing here touches account 1200, so the estate's arrears
 * stay exactly where `EstateFinanceSeeder`'s own guard expects them.
 *
 * WHY MAY HAS THREE EMPLOYEES AND EVERY OTHER MONTH HAS FOUR. Because Wayne
 * Thomas was "Employed since Jun 2026", which board 37 says itself. Board 13's
 * May variance — 88,000 of gross and Thomas's exact net — follows from the
 * register rather than from an exclusion somebody had to invent.
