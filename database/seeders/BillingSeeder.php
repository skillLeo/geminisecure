/**
 * Plans, subscriptions and a short invoice history.
 *
 * THE BOARDS ARE THE SPECIFICATION FOR DEMO DATA.
 *
 * A reviewer comparing a screen against the design they signed off cannot tell
 * a layout fault from a seeding accident. The approved boards state what each
 * client is — Phoenix Park Village 1 is the flagship Premium account at 450
 * units and $171,000 a month, Ocean View Gardens is mid-onboarding at 320 —
 * so the seed says the same, and every screen that shows a client agrees with
 * every other.
 *
 * This was previously seeded by loop index: estate 0 active, the rest dunning,
 * units 48 + 22i. That made Phoenix Park a dunning Standard client with no
 * MRR, which is the opposite of what the boards draw, and the Client Detail
 * screen's own hero card sizes to its content — so shorter data made a
 * narrower card and shifted the entire action column against the design.
 *
 * PRICES ARE THE BOARDS', and three of them agree.
 *
 * The package builder and the client line items screens both print the rate
 * card — Essential J$180, Standard J$260, Premium J$340 per unit per month —
 * and the invoice board decomposes Phoenix Park's August bill as 450 units at
 * J$340 plus 4 guards at J$4,500, which reconciles to the J$171,000 the
 * dashboard shows. Four boards, one arithmetic.
 *
 * These were first derived from the dashboard's MRR panel alone, which gave
 * J$380 per unit — right total, wrong decomposition, because the guard add-on
 * was invisible in that one figure. The error survived the pixel harness
 * because a tier price is three short strings in a table header and three
 * wrong prices cost less than the 2% threshold. It was the invoice board's
 * breakdown that exposed it.
 *
 * One estate stays in `dunning` deliberately. The billing screen claims that
 * dunning gates billing features only and never restricts access, and that
 * claim is worth nothing if no estate is ever in dunning to demonstrate it.
