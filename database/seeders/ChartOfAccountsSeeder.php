/**
 * The estate's chart of accounts - board screen community-admin-25.
 *
 * Every account the board draws, at its own code, plus the one it does not.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS AN EQUITY ACCOUNT THE BOARD DOES NOT SHOW. The board groups its
 * chart under Assets, Liabilities, Income and Expenses. Total those four as
 * drawn and they do not balance: J$11,640,904 of debits against J$3,084,185 of
 * credits, out by J$8,556,719. That difference is not a mistake in the figures -
 * it IS the estate's accumulated fund, the members' equity, and every set of
 * books has one. The Build Spec's `account` entity lists `equity` as one of the
 * five types precisely because a ledger cannot balance without it.
 *
 * So 3000 Accumulated Fund is real, it is in the chart, and the screen shows it.
 * The alternative was a chart of accounts screen that hides an account from the
 * accountant, and a trial balance that could never agree. Recorded as a content
 * residual against the board rather than resolved by hiding a row.
 *
 * TWO CONTROL ACCOUNTS, and they are what `gate:ledger` ties:
 *   1200 Dues Receivable    against every UNIT's balance — the property owes
 *                           the dues, so a vacant unit still has a ledger
 *   2000 Accounts Payable   against every vendor's balance
 *
 * TWO BANK ACCOUNTS, flagged, because bank reconciliation reconciles one
 * account against one statement and cannot know which without being told.
 *
 * Runs INSIDE tenancy. Every account here belongs to one estate and lives in
 * that estate's own database.
