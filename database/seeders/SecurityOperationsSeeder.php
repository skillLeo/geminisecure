/**
 * A day at the gates, and the incident log behind it — board screens 26 and 27.
 *
 * TWO SCREENS THAT CANNOT BE REVIEWED EMPTY. The live activity feed reads as a
 * broken screen when it is blank rather than as a quiet night, and an incident
 * log with nothing in it cannot demonstrate the one distinction it exists to
 * draw — an incident somebody closed against one nobody did.
 *
 * THE DAY IS SEEDED WHOLE, NOT AS THE SEVEN ROWS THE BOARD DRAWS. The board's
 * KPI cards report sixty-three admits and four denials, and its feed shows the
 * seven most recent events; those two facts can only both be true if the day
 * behind them is real. So a real day is written — sixty-seven decisions spread
 * across the hours the gates were open — and the feed shows whatever the most
 * recent seven of it happen to be, merged with the patrol scans and shift
 * starts the dispatch seed already wrote.
 *
 * Everything here is flagged is_simulated. Nothing in this file came from a
 * handset, and the console says so rather than presenting a demonstration as a
 * record of a night that happened.
