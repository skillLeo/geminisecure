     * knows nothing about a site beyond its name. The boards do: "Waterloo
     * Road, St. Andrew · 5 phases · Client since Mar 2024". Those are facts
     * about a physical place a security company guards, so they are seeded
     * here and stored as real columns rather than left implied by a screen.
     *
     * The name matters for a second reason: the client detail hero sizes to
     * its content and everything beside it follows, so "Phoenix Park" against
     * the board's "Phoenix Park Village 1" moved the whole action column.
     *
     * `status` is here for the same reason the address is: it is a fact the
     * boards state about these two clients, not an accident of when the
     * database was built. Four boards draw Ocean View mid-onboarding — the
     * directory badges it "Onboarding" and shows no MRR, its detail draws an
     * onboarding checklist, and both the plan and the new-client boards refer
     * to it in those words — while Phoenix Park is drawn live throughout.
     * Provisioning leaves every estate in whichever state it was created in,
     * so without this the demo platform has no onboarding client at all and
     * that half of the client detail screen can never be reached.
