/**
 * Gemini Security's own guard payroll: the rate card, one calculated run, and
 * the returns owed on it.
 *
 * THE RATE CARD COMES FROM ITS OWN SEEDER NOW. The Jamaica-wide TAJ cards are
 * not a fact about Gemini's guards — the estates' own payrolls read the same
 * table — and the client's ruling on Q-002 replaced the single provisional card
 * this file used to write with dated versions either side of each 1 April. See
 * `StatutoryRatesSeeder`.
 *
 * THE RUN TAKES THE CARD IN FORCE ON ITS PAY DATE. Never "the latest": a run
 * paid in March is taxed on March's threshold, which is the 2025-04 card, and
 * one paid in April on the 2026-04 card. `StatutoryRateVersion::forPayDate()` is
 * the selector, and the version is stored on the run so it reproduces exactly.
 *
 * The run stops at `calculated`. Approving it is a person's act, taken on the
 * payroll screen with the first-live-run acknowledgement the ruling asks for,
 * not something a seeder does on anybody's behalf.
