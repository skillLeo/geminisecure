/**
 * The Jamaican statutory rate card, as the client ruled it on Q-002 (D-082).
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD CHANGES EVERY 1 APRIL, AND INCOME TAX IS ASSESSED ON A CALENDAR
 * YEAR. So a calendar year spans two versions — January to March 2026 is the
 * 2025-04 card, April to December the 2026-04 one — and a pay run takes the
 * version in force on its pay date. That is what `StatutoryRateVersion::
 * forPayDate()` is for, and why this seeds the versions either side of each
 * 1 April rather than "the current rates".
 *
 * TAJ'S PERIODIC FIGURES ARE STORED, NEVER DERIVED. They do not equal the annual
 * threshold divided by 12, 26 or 52 — TAJ rounds differently — and the ruling is
 * explicit: store what TAJ publishes. The 2025-04 and 2026-04 cards carry all
 * three and are verified. The 2024-04 and 2027-04 cards were ruled on their
 * annual figure alone; no periodic figures were supplied, so they are seeded
 * UNVERIFIED. The engine can still calculate against them by division, and no run
 * can be approved against them until somebody records TAJ's published figures —
 * which reuses the approval block this platform already has, rather than inventing
 * a second one for the same risk.
 *
 * NOT COUNTERSIGNED. These figures are from TAJ publications and the client's
 * ruling on method, and reconcile to the cent against both worked payslips. The
 * client's accountant has not signed them. `verified_by` says so, and the first
 * live pay run carries an explicit acknowledgement for the same reason (Part F).
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT, and it never edits a version a run may have used. Superseding the
 * provisional card is a flag, not an edit to its figures.
