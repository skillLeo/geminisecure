/**
 * The standing orders library - board screen super-admin-25.
 *
 * Five order sets: the company-wide general orders every guard is inducted on,
 * the emergency annex, and one post-specific set for each gate that has its
 * own written instructions.
 *
 * The acknowledgements are the point of the screen, so they are seeded against
 * the guard actually posted at each gate rather than scattered: Marcus Whyte
 * has signed for Phoenix Park's Main Gate, Kadeem Foster for Ocean View's, and
 * Phoenix Park's Service Gate has nobody who can sign at all - Devon Palmer is
 * posted there and his PSRA licence has lapsed, which makes him un-rosterable.
 * That last row is the one worth having in a demonstration dataset: an order
 * set in force at a post no one can legally stand.
 *
 * Idempotent. Every insert is keyed on the set's title, so running this twice
 * revises nothing and duplicates nothing.
