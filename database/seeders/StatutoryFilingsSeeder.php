/**
 * The statutory register as it stands today: one return owed, two filed, one
 * not yet owed.
 *
 * WHERE THE FIGURES COME FROM. The two filed returns are HISTORY - the runs
 * they were paid from predate this system, so there is no run row to point at.
 * Their amounts are therefore recorded as the engine's own output for the same
 * roster at the same rates, rather than typed in: a seeded remittance that does
 * not reconcile to the calculator would teach the reader that the two are
 * allowed to disagree.
 *
 * The owed return has NO amounts, and that is deliberate. Its period has closed
 * but no approved run covers it - D-021 holds every run short of approval - and
 * the Build Spec's rule for this screen is that amounts derive from approved
 * runs only. A provisional figure here would be a number somebody could remit.
 *
 * Everything is anchored to the current month rather than to fixed dates, so
 * the register still reads correctly whenever the demo data is rebuilt.
