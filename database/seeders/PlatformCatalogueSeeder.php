 * THE BOARDS ARE THE SPECIFICATION FOR DEMO DATA, exactly as BillingSeeder
 * says. A reviewer comparing Platform settings against the design they signed
 * off cannot tell a layout fault from a seeding accident, so what the approved
 * boards state is what this seeds:
 *
 *   board 42  the platform rate card, including the per-guard add-on
 *   board 43  which tier includes which feature, cell for cell
 *   board 44  one addition and one removal on a Standard client
 *
 * ASSUMPTION Q-002: the per-guard Security Provider rate. Board 42 is the only
 * supplied document that states one, in the same way board 02's MRR panel was
 * the only place tier prices were stated and BillingSeeder took them from
 * there. It is an assumption, not a ruling, and it is recorded as one.
 *
 * Runs after BillingSeeder: plan_features hangs off plans, which that seeder
 * creates. Ordering it earlier would silently seed nothing at all.
