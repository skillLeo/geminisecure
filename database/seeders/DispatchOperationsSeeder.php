/**
 * Today's dispatch picture: rosters, patrol tours, alertness challenges,
 * inbound requests and the message log.
 *
 * The four dispatch boards are OPERATIONAL surfaces — who is on duty, which
 * post is empty, who has stopped scanning. An empty database renders every one
 * of them as a first-use empty state, which is a truthful screen and a useless
 * one: nobody can review a coverage board that has no coverage on it.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY IMPERFECT. Devon Palmer's licence has lapsed, so Phoenix Park's
 * Service Gate stands unmanned, and Andre Simpson has stopped scanning halfway
 * round his tour. A seed where every post is covered and every guard is awake
 * would leave the uncovered-post row and the missed-checkpoint banner permanently
 * unreachable — which is to say untested, on the two screens that exist for
 * exactly those cases.
 *
 * Everything device-originated is flagged is_simulated, so the console can say
 * plainly that a scan came from the seed rather than from a handset.
