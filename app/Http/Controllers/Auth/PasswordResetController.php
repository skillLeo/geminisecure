/**
 * Forgot password — both doors. Ruled (12 §2, Wave 1): single-use token,
 * 30-minute expiry, verified address, identical confirmation whether or not
 * the account exists.
 *
 * ONE SENTENCE WHATEVER HAPPENED. The request page answers "if that address
 * holds an account, a link has been sent" to a known address, an unknown one,
 * a suspended account and a throttled retry alike — because the sign-in form
 * already refuses to say which addresses hold accounts, and a reset form that
 * said "we don't know that address" would hand out the same list one guess at
 * a time. Laravel's broker returns a different status for each case; every
 * one of them lands on the same words.
 *
 * THE TOKEN IS THE FRAMEWORK'S. Hashed at rest, bound to the address, expired
 * by `auth.passwords.users.expire` (30) and deleted the moment it is used. A
 * second visit with the same link is refused as invalid, which is what
 * "single-use" means.
 *
 * THE VERIFIED ADDRESS is the one on the account: the link carries the email
 * the token was issued for, and the broker refuses a token presented with any
 * other. Nothing on the reset page can move a token to a different account.
 *
 * DRAWN ON THE SAME CARD AS SIGN-IN, on whichever door it was reached from:
 * `door()` reads the tenant the same way `LoginController` does.
