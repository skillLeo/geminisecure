/**
 * Access and audit log, Super Admin screen 41.
 *
 * Read-only, and it offers no way to change anything — not even a disabled
 * one. A greyed-out delete button says deletion is a thing that could be
 * switched on, and for this table it cannot be: audit_log is append-only at a
 * withheld grant, at a database trigger and in App\Models\AuditEntry. So this
 * screen has no edit control, no delete control, and no route that would
 * accept one.
 *
 * Everything the reader can change — the search, the three filters, the sort
 * and the page — is a GET parameter, resolved here and applied in the query.
 * That makes any view of the log a URL somebody else can be sent, which is
 * what an audit trail is usually being read for.
 *
 * Requested parameters are sanitised rather than validated. A hand-edited or
 * stale URL should show the log it can make sense of, with the filters it
 * understood named above the table, rather than bounce the reader to an error.
