/**
 * One-click sign-in as any role. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY.
 *
 * This is an authentication bypass. It exists so the 13 roles can be compared
 * without maintaining 13 sets of credentials, and it must never be reachable
 * anywhere but a developer's machine.
 *
 * THREE INDEPENDENT GUARDS, deliberately redundant:
 *
 *   1. routes/web.php registers these routes only when app()->isLocal()
 *   2. every action calls assertLocal() again, so the controller is inert even
 *      if a route were registered by mistake
 *   3. the accounts it creates are marked with a recognisable email domain and
 *      an unusable random password, so they cannot be signed into by hand and
 *      are trivial to find and delete
 *
 * Guard 2 matters because guard 1 is a single line in a route file, and a
 * single line is exactly the kind of thing that gets moved during a refactor.
