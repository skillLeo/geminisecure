/**
 * Category B — every web screen whose primary dataset originates on a mobile device (13 C3).
 *
 * THE DEFINITION, as ruled: "any screen whose primary dataset originates on a
 * mobile device". Made testable here as: the records a screen exists to show are
 * written by a `/api/v1` endpoint a handset calls — built today, or specified for
 * the Guard App and Resident App in 13 D2/D3. A screen that merely mentions a
 * device figure beside records typed in a console is not Category B, and each
 * such near miss is listed in `EXCLUDED` with its reason, so the boundary is a
 * decision on the record rather than an omission.
 *
 * EVERY SCREEN HERE RENDERS `SourceBadge`, computed from its own rows.
 * `CategoryBTest` asserts both directions: each listed page renders the badge,
 * and no page renders it without being listed. `docs/CATEGORY_B.md` is the same
 * list for people.
