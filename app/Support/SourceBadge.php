/**
 * Says, on a web screen, that the data below it came off a mobile device — and
 * whether a real one produced it.
 *
 * WHY THE CLIENT ASKED FOR THIS. Roughly forty web screens display data the
 * Guard App and the Resident App generate, and neither app exists yet. The
 * simulator drives the same /api/v1 endpoints the real apps will call, which is
 * the right way to build against them — and it means a reviewer looking at the
 * live map cannot tell, from the screen alone, whether the alert in front of
 * them came from a handset at a gate or from `simulate:alerts`. The badge says
 * so, at a glance and without asking.
 *
 * IT IS COMPUTED FROM THE ROWS ON THE SCREEN, NEVER FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. The
 * tempting shortcut is `app()->isLocal()`, and it would be wrong twice: a
 * demonstration on a staging host would claim its simulated data was real, and
 * a locally-run integration test against a real handset would claim the
 * opposite. Only the rows know, and every table a handset writes carries
 * `is_simulated` for exactly this — `duress_alerts`, `alertness_checks`,
 * `checkpoint_scans`, `gate_events`, `shifts`, `guard_requests`,
 * `security_incidents`, and in each estate `maintenance_tickets`,
 * `amenity_bookings`, `unit_claims` and `ballot_receipts` (13 C3).
 *
 * MIXED COUNTS AS SIMULATED. A queue holding nine real alerts and one simulated
 * one is not a real queue: the figure a reviewer is about to quote includes a
 * number nobody dialled. Any is enough.
