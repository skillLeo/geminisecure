/**
 * Whether a pass may be issued or admitted for a household, and why not.
 *
 * The single place that answers the restriction question. Both the Estate
 * Console and the Guard App's /api/v1 endpoints call this, so a guard at a gate
 * and a committee member at a desk can never be told different things about the
 * same household.
 *
 * THE RULES (D-024, client ruling)
 * --------------------------------
 * Estate-configurable, with these defaults:
 *   - eligible at 90 days overdue
 *   - 14 days' written notice before restriction takes effect
 *   - guest passes only
 *
 * NOT configurable, and enforced here rather than in a settings table:
 *   - a resident's own entry is never restricted
 *   - emergency and medical vehicles are never restricted
 *
 * Those two live in code because a settings table can be misconfigured, and a
 * misconfigured estate leaving an ambulance at a gate is not a recoverable
 * error. No estate may widen what restriction covers; it may only switch it off.
 *
 * AND THREE RULES THAT PREDATE THE CONFIGURATION
 *   - restriction follows ARREARS, never a failed payment
 *   - a declined card or a gateway outage never restricts anything
 *   - restriction never blocks a safety function
 *
 * A PAYMENT PLAN LIFTS RESTRICTION WHILE IT IS BEING MET (board 7). That is
 * checked here, after the exemptions and only for a household that is otherwise
 * restricted, so it can widen admission and can never narrow it — an edit to
 * the collections module cannot reach an ambulance, because the exempt path has
 * already returned by the time a plan is consulted.
 *
 * THE GUARD IS NEVER TOLD A PLAN EXISTS. A plan is a fact about money, and the
 * verdict this class returns carries no key and no wording that could reveal
 * one; a household on a plan is admitted exactly as a household with no arrears
 * is admitted, and is indistinguishable from one at the gate (invariant 2).
