/**
 * The rate table screen, assembled from the rates and a real pay run.
 *
 * D-021 IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS SCREEN, not a caveat on it.
 *
 * The rates the engine calculates with have never been checked against a
 * worked example by anyone qualified to check them, so they are a DRAFT and no
 * run may be approved against them. The screen therefore has to do two things
 * at once: show the arithmetic honestly enough that an accountant can check it,
 * and state plainly that nobody has. Both are here. What is deliberately NOT
 * here is any means of approving them.
 *
 * THE WORKED EXAMPLE IS A REAL PAYSLIP, NOT AN ILLUSTRATION.
 *
 * A rate table whose example is invented proves nothing: it demonstrates the
 * arithmetic somebody typed rather than the arithmetic the engine performed.
 * So the example is a payslip off the most recent run, and its six lines add up
 * to that payslip's net pay to the cent. If they ever stop adding up, the
 * screen is telling the truth about a real defect.
 *
 * WHICH payslip is a rule, not a pick: the one immediately ABOVE the PAYE
 * threshold, because that is the only kind of payslip on which all four
 * deductions are visible at once. Where every guard falls below it, the highest
 * earner stands in and the PAYE line says why it is zero.
