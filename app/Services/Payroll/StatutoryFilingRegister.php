/**
 * The register of returns Gemini Security owes the Jamaican authorities.
 *
 * Everything this screen shows is a fact about a record plus a rule about the
 * calendar, and both live here rather than in the controller: whether a return
 * is owed yet, whether it is late, and whether a new one can be prepared at all.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT GOVERNS THIS MODULE (Build Spec, screen 30):
 *
 *     Amounts derive from APPROVED runs only. A draft run never appears in a
 *     filing.
 *
 * A return is prepared from an APPROVED run and never from a calculated one — a
 * remittance is a payment to the tax authority, and paying a figure nobody has
 * approved is exactly the failure this rule exists to prevent. Q-002 is ruled
 * (D-082), so runs on a verified card can now be approved; `blockedReason()`
 * says which of the remaining conditions applies, and the screen's one control
 * carries that sentence.
 *
 * THERE IS NO EDIT AND NO DELETE HERE, NOT EVEN A DISABLED ONE. A filed return
 * is a posted record (invariant 4). A greyed-out delete would tell the reader
 * that deletion is a thing this system does and they simply lack the right to
 * do it, which is false: it is a thing this system does not do.
