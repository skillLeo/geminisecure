 * A card seeded from its annual figure alone is not verified, and a run on it
 * may be calculated for review but never approved — the same block the draft
 * card carried before the ruling, now reserved for the case it actually guards.
 * This class exists so every screen states that in the same words.
 *
 * There is deliberately no method here that approves anything.
 *
 * Rates are basis points throughout - 3% is 300 - so a percentage is formatted
 * by integer division, never by dividing by 100 into a float. A rate that
 * round-trips through a float is a rate that eventually disagrees with the
 * payslip it produced.
