/**
 * Approving one of Gemini Security's own guard pay runs — board super-admin-29.
 *
 * THERE WAS NO APPROVE ROUTE HERE BEFORE, DELIBERATELY. The statutory rates were
 * a draft (D-021), and a route that exists but is guarded is one refactor away
 * from being reachable. The client has ruled on Q-002 (D-082): the TAJ cards are
 * seeded with their published periodic figures and verified, and payroll is to
 * be unblocked. So the route now exists and this is the one door behind it.
 *
 * APPROVE, NOT DISBURSE. The board labels its control "Approve & disburse", and
 * this platform holds no ledger for Gemini's own books — moving the money is the
 * bank transfer Gemini makes. What this records is the decision, who took it,
 * and when; the run then reads "Approved" on board 28, and the statutory register
 * can prepare the returns owed on it.
 *
 * THE FIRST LIVE RUN CARRIES AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, Part F of the ruling. The rates
 * reconcile to the cent against TAJ's tables and nobody at the client has
 * countersigned them, so the first approval asks the approver to confirm the run
 * was reconciled against current TAJ tables, naming the card. Not a block — a
 * tick, recorded with who gave it — and never asked again once a run carries it.
 * The estates' payrolls ask the same question of their own first run
 * (`App\Services\Estate\Payroll`), because each is a different employer.
 *
 * NO SECOND-PERSON RULE HERE, and that is a difference from the estate payroll
 * worth stating. An estate run is PREPARED by a person — board 15 names Tracey
 * Reid — and the preparer may not approve it. A guard run is calculated by the
 * engine from the roster; nobody prepares it by hand, so there is no preparer to
 * exclude. The permission is the control.
