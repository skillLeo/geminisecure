/**
 * The bank file: an instruction to move money into people's accounts.
 *
 * NEUTRAL, AND SAYING SO. Every Jamaican bank takes a bulk-credit upload and no
 * two of their layouts agree — NCB, Scotiabank and JN each want their own column
 * order and their own header. This is the columns every one of them needs, in
 * the order a person reading it would expect, and it is what an estate hands
 * their bank or re-saves into the bank's own template.
 *
 * WHEN A BANK'S OWN SPEC ARRIVES, it becomes a second class beside this one and
 * nothing that calls the adapter changes. That is the whole point of the
 * interface — see `PayrollFileFormat`, and D-023 for the pattern.
 *
 * AN EMPLOYEE WITH NO ACCOUNT IS IN THE FILE, with their account blank and a
 * note saying so. Dropping them would hand the bank a file that pays fewer
 * people than the run approved, and the person who notices is the one who was
 * not paid.
