/**
 * Every export in this system, and the entry each one writes (12 §1).
 *
 * THE RULING: "every export writes an audit entry — actor, scope, row count,
 * timestamp; cross-tenant exports additionally name the tenants included. That
 * audit entry IS the trail the reason asked for."
 *
 * Several inert controls carried a reason saying an export "leaves the estate as
 * a file naming who owes what, and needs a retention rule before it needs a
 * button". The ruling answers it: a file that has left cannot be retained,
 * recalled or deleted by this system, and pretending otherwise would be the
 * worse lie. What CAN be true is that the estate knows a file left, who took it,
 * what was in it and when — and that is what every call here records, BEFORE a
 * byte is streamed, so an export that fails halfway is still on the record.
 *
 * EVERY EXPORT COMES THROUGH HERE. Not because the CSV writing is hard, but
 * because the audit entry is the point: a second export path that wrote its own
 * file would be an export with no trail, and the one that forgets is the one
 * that matters.
