 * Builds a user's navigation from the role access matrix, at runtime.

 * Cross-cutting rule 9: a module a role cannot use is ABSENT from the
 * navigation, not disabled and not greyed. This returns only what the user may
 * reach, so there is no code path by which a forbidden module could render at
 * all — the front end is never handed one to hide.
 *
 * A user with two roles gets the union of their access, taking the highest
 * level where the two disagree. Two roles must never combine to LESS than
 * either grants alone, which is what a naive intersection would produce.

     * a missing route.
     *
     * AND FOR A ROUTE THAT NEEDS A PARAMETER THIS SERVICE CANNOT SUPPLY, which
     * is a sharper edge than it looks. This runs from `HandleInertiaRequests`
     * for EVERY signed-in user on every full page load, and it holds one thing
     * about a module: its key. An estate route carries the estate's identity on
     * the host in production and in the path locally — `{tenant}` either way —
     * so `route()` on one throws `UrlGenerationException`, out of a shared
     * middleware, on every screen in the console at once.
     *
     * That is not hypothetical. `estate.reports` was the first estate route
     * whose name matched its module key exactly, and landing it turned every
     * estate screen into a 500 until this method was taught to say no. Every
     * other estate module is grouped — `estate.residents.index`,
     * `estate.payroll.runs` — so `Route::has()` answered false and the '#'
     * branch hid the problem for thirty-nine screens.
     *
     * `parameterNames()` covers domain parameters as well as path ones, which
     * `Route::has()` does not, and asking is better than catching: the estate
     * sidebar is drawn from `EstateNavigation`, which knows the tenant and
     * builds these paths properly, so a '#' here costs nothing that is rendered.
