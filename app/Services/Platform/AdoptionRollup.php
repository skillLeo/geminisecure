 * Both leave their evidence in gs_platform — shifts, devices, gate decisions —
 * so both can be counted here without opening a single estate database.
 *
 * IT WRITES ONLY WHAT IT OWNS. Dues, facilities, governance and the estate's
 * own payroll are the estate's to count, and their rows arrive from the estate
 * console. This class never touches them, and a capability with no row is left
 * with no row rather than being written as zero — see the table's migration for
 * why those are different facts.
 *
 * COUNTS, NOT PERCENTAGES. "2 of 4 posts" survives a client adding a fifth
 * post; "50%" does not.
