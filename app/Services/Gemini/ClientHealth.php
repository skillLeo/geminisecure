/**
 * Client health — board screen super-admin-07.
 *
 * How much of what each client bought they are actually using, one card per
 * client, a bar per capability.
 *
 * IT READS THE ROLL-UP, NEVER AN ESTATE DATABASE. That constraint is stated on
 * this report's own catalogue card and it is the reason the screen waited for
 * `client_adoption` to exist: adoption of the estate's own modules is recorded
 * inside the estate's own database, and a console that opened each one in turn
 * to build a cross-client report would be a tenant-isolation breach wearing a
 * report's clothes. So the fact's owner rolls it up and this reads the roll-up.
 *
 * A CAPABILITY NOBODY HAS REPORTED ON IS NOT NOUGHT PER CENT. It is listed
 * under the bars, by name, as awaiting a report — because a client shown at the
 * bottom of a health list for a capability nobody has ever counted would have an
 * account manager chasing them over the platform's own gap.
 *
 * THE SCORE IS THE MEAN OF WHAT IS MEASURED, and it says how many capabilities
 * it is a mean OF. A single bar at 100% is not the same claim as four at 100%,
 * and a chip reading "Healthy" off one measurement would make it look like one.
 *
 * NO MONEY AND NO NAMES LEAVE THIS CLASS. Every figure is two integers out of
 * `client_adoption`, which holds neither.
