/**
 * Logging an incident and closing one — board 27's "Log incident" and "View"
 * (12 §2, Wave 2 item 27).
 *
 * AN INCIDENT RECORD IS EVIDENCE. An insurer, a client and the PSRA all read
 * it, so the intake is structured rather than a free-text box: which client,
 * when it happened, what kind of thing it was, how serious, what happened, and
 * — where there was one — the guard on post. Every field but the guard is
 * required, and a record that cannot say when or where is refused rather than
 * kept as half a record.
 *
 * WHO LOGGED IT IS STORED BY NAME AS WELL AS BY ID, and the guard's name beside
 * the guard's id, for the migration's reason: people leave; the record that
 * they were involved cannot leave with them.
 *
 * A RESOLUTION CLOSES AN INCIDENT, AND IS FINAL. The two are written together —
 * an incident marked resolved with no account of what was done reads the same
 * as an open one to whoever comes to it later — and nothing reopens or rewrites
 * a closed incident. Something that recurs is a new incident, with its own date.
