/**
 * What this estate reports about its own take-up — the other half of board 07.
 *
 * `AdoptionRollup` counts the two capabilities GEMINI operates and says in its
 * own docblock that it will never touch the rest: "Dues, facilities, governance
 * and the estate's own payroll are the estate's to count, and their rows arrive
 * from the estate console." This is the class that sends them.
 *
 * WHY IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY ROUND. A cross-client report that opened each
 * estate's database in turn to build itself would be a tenant-isolation breach
 * wearing a report's clothes — the hardest rule this platform has, and one a
 * plausible-looking dashboard is exactly how you break. So the fact's OWNER
 * counts it, inside its own tenancy, and pushes two integers up. `gs_platform`
 * ends up holding "212 of 450" and never learns whose 212.
 *
 * TWO INTEGERS AND A SENTENCE. No names, no money, no household, no unit. The
 * central table has no column that could carry one and this class assembles
 * none. That is what makes a cross-tenant report safe to draw for a Director who
 * may not open a single estate console.
 *
 * NOTHING TO MEASURE IS NOT NOUGHT PER CENT, and the eligible count is what
 * carries that. An estate with no ballot has not failed at governance; it has
 * not held an election. `ClientAdoption::isMeasurable()` reads `eligible > 0`,
 * so a capability with nothing behind it is reported honestly as nothing rather
 * than as a zero that would put a blameless client at the bottom of a health
 * list.
 *
 * COUNTS, NOT PERCENTAGES — the same rule the Gemini side follows. "212 of 450"
 * survives the estate adding a unit; "47%" does not.
