/**
 * Guard alertness and patrol monitoring — board screen super-admin-15.
 *
 * ONE QUESTION: is every guard who is supposed to be on duty right now still
 * demonstrably awake, on their feet and reporting?
 *
 * It is answered from EVIDENCE THE GUARD PRODUCED, never from the roster. A
 * shift row says somebody was rostered and clocked in; it says nothing about
 * the four hours since. Two kinds of evidence exist and they are alternatives
 * rather than a pair, which is why the board draws them as two columns and why
 * a row usually carries a dash in one of them:
 *
 *   a patrol guard proves it by SCANNING the next checkpoint on the tour
 *   a static guard has no checkpoint to reach, so the periodic alertness
 *   CHALLENGE is the only signal there is
 *
 * SILENCE IS THE FINDING, and it is the whole point of the screen. A guard who
 * has stopped scanning has either sat down, been hurt, or lost their handset,
 * and all three need a dispatcher. So an absent scan is escalated on its own
 * timer rather than waiting for something to arrive — which is why the overdue
 * calculation below is driven by the clock rather than by a row appearing.
 *
 * NO POSITION IS READ, DERIVED OR RETURNED. A checkpoint scan proves a guard
 * physically reached a fixed, named point; it is not a coordinate and cannot be
 * turned back into a track. Nothing on this screen could be broadcast as a
 * guard's live position, because no such value exists anywhere to broadcast.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE HOLDS AN AMOUNT, and none of the tables it reads has a money
 * column. Invariant 2 stands on structure rather than on remembering.
 *
 * The screen polls this class every five seconds, so it stays cheap: five
 * indexed queries, no per-row lookups, and all the grouping done in PHP.
