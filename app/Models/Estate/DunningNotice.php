/**
 * One arrears reminder, AS IT WAS SENT — board 8's left pane.
 *
 * "Every dunning notice is logged with its exact sent content, so a dispute can
 * be settled from the record." That sentence is this table's entire reason for
 * existing, and it is why `subject` and `body` are stored here in full rather
 * than looked up through `dunning_template_id`. The template can be reworded or
 * archived tomorrow; a log that re-rendered from today's wording would show a
 * resident a message they were never sent, which is the one failure it exists
 * to prevent.
 *
 * `template_label`, `stage` AND `channel` ARE COPIED FOR THE SAME REASON, not
 * for convenience. Asked six months later which step went out on the 20th, the
 * answer has to come from this row alone.
 *
 * NO BALANCE IS STORED HERE. Board 8 draws a Balance column and it is read from
 * the ledger when the screen is drawn — a figure kept beside the accounts is
 * free to disagree with them, and the amount a resident was actually quoted is
 * already preserved, rendered into `body`, which is the only place a dispute
 * would look.
