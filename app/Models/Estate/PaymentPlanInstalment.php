/**
 * One dated step of a payment plan.
 *
 * THE STATE IS RECORDED, NOT DERIVED, and the migration argues why: an
 * instalment is met by a DECISION as well as by an amount. A treasurer can
 * accept a short payment as meeting one — a household that pays J$3,050 of a
 * J$3,100 instalment has not walked away from the agreement — and no rule over
 * the payments table could express that without the treasurer being asked.
 *
 * WHICH MAKES `missed` THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL FIELD IN THE MODULE. It is the
 * fact that defaults the plan, and defaulting the plan is what puts the arrears
 * restriction back on a household's guest passes. Nothing sets it by elapsed
 * time; `Collections::markMissed` is a deliberate act with a person behind it,
 * for the same reason restriction never follows a failed card.
