/**
 * A period carved out of an amenity's diary — the holds and blackouts board 19's
 * slot view draws, and what "block a slot" writes.
 *
 * A SLOT ROW IS AN EXCLUSION, NEVER A MATERIALISED AVAILABILITY. The bookable
 * periods are the amenity's opening hours less what is already taken; a table
 * with a row per hour per amenity per day would grow without bound and still
 * could not answer a question about next year, which is the one a resident asks.
 * So availability is derived and only the exceptions are stored.
 *
 * TWO KINDS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS WHAT A RESIDENT IS TOLD. A `blocked` period
 * is the estate's own decision about its diary — resurfacing, a private
 * function, a closure — and a `hold` is a request in flight. Both refuse an
 * overlapping booking; only one of them means the amenity is unavailable, and
 * telling somebody the Gazebo is closed when it is merely spoken for is a
 * different sentence with a different answer.
