/**
 * Something that stops a run being calculated — board 14's two rows.
 *
 * AN EXCEPTION IS RESOLVED, NEVER DELETED. Board 14 offers "Exclude" beside
 * "Enter manually" and "Approve as-is" beside "Review hours", and all four are
 * resolutions rather than dismissals: each one is a decision somebody made
 * about a person's pay, and the reason a technician's 22 overtime hours went
 * through unchallenged is exactly what an auditor asks about six months later.
 * So `status` moves and `resolution_note`, `resolved_by` and `resolved_at`
 * record who decided what — the row stays.
 *
 * `EXCLUDED` IS NOT `RESOLVED`, and the difference is a person's wages. An
 * excluded employee is left OUT of the run entirely: no payslip, no gross, no
 * net. That is why board 13's May 2026 run shows three employees against the
 * other months' four, and why its totals differ by exactly one person's figures
 * rather than by a rounding. A run that treated exclusion as resolution would
 * pay somebody nothing and report itself complete.
