/**
 * A supplier the estate buys from — boards 26 and 39.
 *
 * THE REGISTER, not the money. What this vendor is owed is the balance of its
 * lines on 2000 Accounts Payable, and what it has been paid is the debits on the
 * same account; neither is stored here, for the same reason no account carries a
 * balance. This row holds what bookkeeping has no place for — a trade, a phone
 * number, and a taxpayer registration number.
 *
 * THE TRN IS REQUIRED AT PAYMENT, NOT AT RECORDING, and the column is nullable
 * because of it. A bill arrives whether or not the supplier's paperwork is in
 * order; refusing to record it would understate what the estate owes, which is
 * the one thing a payables ledger exists to state. Withholding compliance bites
 * when money actually moves, and `Payables::pay()` is where it bites.
 *
 * `category` HOLDS THE TRADE, NOT THE LEDGER GROUPING. Board 39 calls "Electrical
 * contractor" the vendor's category and board 26 draws it as the subtitle under
 * the name, so that is what is stored. The coarse Maintenance/Utilities column
 * board 26 also draws is NOT stored beside it: it is which expense account this
 * vendor's bills actually post to, read back from the journal by
 * `Payables::expenseAccountsByVendor()`. A second copy kept here would be free to
 * say "Maintenance" about a vendor whose costs all landed on 5200.
 *
 * DEACTIVATED, NEVER DELETED. A vendor with bills against it is history the
 * estate has to keep, and a restricting foreign key on `bills.vendor_id` says so
 * at the database.
