/**
 * A person asserting they belong to a unit — boards 4 and 31.
 *
 * WHAT WAS SUBMITTED IS STORED VERBATIM AND NEVER NORMALISED. Board 31 draws two
 * columns side by side and the whole value of the screen is the difference
 * between them: "Keith Walters" against a register that reads "K. A. Walters",
 * a phone the claimant gave against a phone the estate does not hold. Tidying
 * the submission into the register's shape before storing it would erase the
 * question the reviewer is being asked.
 *
 * `unit_id` IS NULLABLE. Board 31's third card is titled "Unknown claimant"
 * because the estate could not resolve what the person typed to anything it
 * holds. That claim still has to be answered, and refusing to record it because
 * it did not match would lose exactly the submissions that need a human.
 *
 * APPROVING ONE IS `approve`, NOT `update` (D-013). It binds a person to a
 * household — which decides whose guest passes they may issue and whose gate
 * they may be admitted at — and no edit afterwards unbinds the night somebody
 * was let through. The gate is on the route; this record carries who decided and
 * when, so the decision survives the committee that made it.
 *
 * NO JOURNAL IS EVER RAISED BY ANYTHING HERE. A claim approval changes who is
 * authorised against a unit and changes nothing about what the unit owes. Board
 * 31's own note says so, and `EstateResidentsTest` proves it by counting entries
 * either side of an approval.
