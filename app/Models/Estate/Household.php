/**
 * A household occupying a unit. Estate database only.
 *
 * `access_restricted` is the ONLY thing about a household's standing that a
 * guard is ever told — a boolean, never an amount, never an ageing bucket,
 * never a payment history (invariant 2).
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE ONLY THING A CONSOLE SCREEN MAY DRAW ABOUT A RESTRICTED
 * HOUSEHOLD. Boards 4 and 38 both put a balance where a household's standing
 * goes, and where that household is restricted the figure is withheld and the
 * verdict drawn instead — amber, and the words D-025 fixed, and no amount and no
 * number of days. `Residents::standingOf()` is the single place that decides it,
 * so there is exactly one function to audit rather than one per screen.
 *
 * `last_active_at` IS STORED RATHER THAN DERIVED, and the reason is where the
 * evidence lives. What board 4's column measures — a resident opening the app,
 * booking an amenity, being admitted at a gate — is spread over three systems
 * and two databases, one of them Gemini's own. A read that fanned out over all
 * of them would put three joins behind a list screen and a cross-database one at
 * that; the writers stamp it instead.
