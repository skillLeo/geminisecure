/**
 * One employee's payslip within one run — a row of board 15's table.
 *
 * EVERY FIGURE HERE IS COMPUTED, NOT TYPED. `PayrollCalculator` produces the
 * five deductions from gross and a rate version, in an order that is itself
 * load-bearing: NIS first because Education Tax and PAYE are both charged on
 * income after it. This model stores that result; it does not reproduce the
 * arithmetic, and nothing else in the application may either.
 *
 * `net_minor` IS STORED RATHER THAN DERIVED ON READ, and that is the one place
 * this module departs from the ledger's own rule that a balance is never kept
 * beside the entries it is made of. The reason is that a payslip is a statement
 * issued to a person on a date: recomputing it later against whatever rate
 * version is current would silently restate what somebody was told they earned.
 * The row is the record of what was actually paid. `EstatePayrollTest` asserts
 * gross less the four deductions equals it, so a stored figure that drifted
 * from its own components fails rather than standing.
