/**
 * One member of the estate's own staff — board 37.
 *
 * NOT A GUARD, AND NEVER LINKED TO ONE. Security guards are Gemini Security
 * Limited's employees, paid centrally out of `gs_platform`'s `payroll_runs`; a
 * Property Manager, a groundskeeper, a maintenance technician and an
 * administrative assistant are this ESTATE's employees, paid out of this
 * estate's own bank account. Board 13's own intro draws that line in words and
 * `Payroll` draws it in code — see DECISIONS.md D-057.
 *
 * BEING ON THIS TABLE IS NOT PERMISSION TO READ IT. Patricia Morgan is both
 * the Property Manager — the role D-010 locks out of `payroll` entirely — and
 * employee row one on board 15. Her own salary line is exactly as invisible to
 * her signed-in session as everyone else's; a `user_id` column here would
 * invite a shortcut ("show me my own line") that the route gate has to refuse
 * regardless of whose name is on the row, so this model carries no link to
 * `users` at all.
 *
 * WHAT IS STORED IS THE WHOLE VALUE; WHAT IS SHOWN IS THE MASK. A bank account
 * number and a NIS number are needed in full to actually pay somebody and to
 * remit a statutory deduction against the right record — but board 37 prints
 * "NCB •••• 3315" and "••• •••5 208", and no board anywhere shows more.
 * `maskedBankAccount()` and `maskedNisNumber()` are the only two routes a
 * controller payload takes to either column.
