/**
 * What a mark can be cast for: a candidate, or For / Against / Abstain.
 *
 * THE ONLY THING `ballot_marks` POINTS AT, and the reason a mark needs no other
 * column. A mark is an option id and a random key, and that is the entire row.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM `nominations`, AND BOARD 11 IS THE PROOF. Andre Thompson wins a
 * Vice Chairman seat on the results screen and appears in no nomination row on
 * board 10. A ballot paper is settled when nominations close and stops depending
 * on the vetting record that produced it — otherwise a nomination re-decided
 * afterwards would silently rewrite a paper people had already voted on, and
 * there is no way to un-cast the votes that were made against the old one.
 *
 * `unit_id` HERE IS THE CANDIDATE'S OWN HOUSEHOLD, NOT A VOTER'S. It is the one
 * household on a ballot paper that is meant to be identifiable: board 11 prints
 * "Phase 1" under a winner's name, and an eligibility check needs a unit to run
 * the arrears ageing against. Nothing joins it to `ballot_receipts`, and nothing
 * may — a candidate is also a voter, and the fact that Dwayne Robinson stands
 * for Chairman says nothing whatever about how Dwayne Robinson voted.
