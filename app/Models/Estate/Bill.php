/**
 * What the estate owes one supplier — board 27's sub-ledger row.
 *
 * THE INVOICE, not the accounting. The entry raised on approval is the
 * liability; this row carries the due date, the supplier's paperwork state and
 * the work order it came from — none of which belongs on a journal line.
 *
 * A BILL IS RECORDED BEFORE IT IS APPROVED, and a draft raises no journal at
 * all. That gap is the point: an invoice that has arrived but has not been agreed
 * is not yet a liability, and posting it on arrival would let a disputed bill
 * change the estate's accounts before anybody decided it should.
 *
 * `status` IS THE WORKFLOW, NOT THE BOARD'S BADGE. Board 27 draws Unpaid,
 * Overdue and Paid; this column holds draft, approved, paid and void. "Overdue"
 * is not a state anything sets — it is an approved bill whose due date has
 * passed, which is arithmetic against today and would be a lie the moment it was
 * stored. `boardStatus()` derives it.
