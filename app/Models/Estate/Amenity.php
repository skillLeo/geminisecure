/**
 * A shared facility residents may book — board 20's rate card.
 *
 * IT SOURCES POSTINGS AND MAKES NONE. Every figure on board 19 and every amenity
 * charge on a unit's ledger derives from the two amounts here, and the board's
 * own note says why they cannot be one column: a BOOKING FEE is revenue, earned
 * and non-refundable, and a DEPOSIT is a refundable liability that is never
 * recognised as income. Conflating them would credit 4100 with money the estate
 * has to give back.
 *
 * NULL IS NOT ZERO ON EITHER OF THEM. Board 20 draws "Free for residents"
 * against the Pool Deck's fee and "None" against its deposit — statements about
 * the amenity rather than amounts — and the board's accounting note is explicit
 * that a nil amenity must "produce a booking with zero journal lines rather than
 * a zero-amount entry". A zero-value journal entry is a row in the ledger
 * claiming something happened.
 *
 * EDITING THIS RECORD CHANGES NOTHING ALREADY BOOKED. A booking copies the fee,
 * the deposit and the cancellation rule at creation; see `AmenityBooking`. That
 * is what lets board 19's Deposit column keep agreeing with the deposits
 * actually held after a manager edits the rate card.
 *
 * `closes_at` MAY HOLD 24:00:00. Board 20 draws the Community Centre closing at
 * "Midnight", and 00:00:00 would sort before every opening time and make the
 * amenity closed all day. MySQL's TIME type carries it; nothing here casts these
 * two columns to Carbon, because Carbon cannot parse the twenty-fourth hour.
