/**
 * The minutes of a meeting that has been held — board 36's "View minutes".
 *
 * THEIR EXISTENCE IS WHAT SPLITS BOARD 36'S ROW ACTION. A meeting with an agenda
 * and no minutes is one nobody has held yet, and the row offers "View agenda"; a
 * meeting with minutes offers "View minutes". That is a fact about the record
 * rather than a status somebody remembers to set, which is why it is a row in a
 * table and not a column on the meeting.
 *
 * `adopted_at` IS NOT A FORMALITY. Minutes are one person's account until a
 * subsequent meeting adopts them, and an adopted set is the estate's record —
 * the document a resolution is proved from and a dispute is settled against. The
 * timestamp is the only thing that tells the two apart, and a set of minutes
 * with no adoption on it is a draft however long it has been sitting there.
