 *
 * NO BALANCE IS STORED HERE. An account's balance is the sum of its posted

 * ledger that is free to drift from it — and the copy is the one a committee
 * reads, so the drift is invisible until an auditor arrives.
 *
 * ARCHIVED, NEVER DELETED once anything is posted to it. The Build Spec is
 * explicit, and the database enforces it with a restricting foreign key on
 * `journal_lines.account_id` rather than leaving it to a check somebody has to
 * remember.
