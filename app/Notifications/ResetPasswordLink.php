 * The password reset email — both doors.

 * THE LINK LANDS ON THE USER'S OWN DOOR. A committee member's estate is on its
 * own hostname in production and under /estate/{tenant} locally, and the card
 * they reset on should be the one they sign in on — "Phoenix Park Village ·
 * Powered by Gemini Security", not the internal console's mark. Gemini staff
 * land on the central door. `ConsoleHome` already knows both shapes.
 *
 * THIRTY MINUTES AND ONCE. The broker hashes the token, expires it after the
 * `expire` in config/auth.php, and deletes it on use; this message says so in
 * words, because a link that stops working is less alarming when it said it
 * would.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SAYS WHETHER THE ADDRESS WAS KNOWN. The message only ever
 * reaches an address that holds an account; the screen that sent it says the
 * same sentence either way.
