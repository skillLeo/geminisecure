/**
 * Layer 1 of invariant 4: the estate's MySQL user must hold no UPDATE or
 * DELETE privilege on an append-only table.
 *
 * WHY THIS INVERTS 06_OVERRIDE §6's SQL
 * -------------------------------------
 * §6 specifies `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ON db.journals FROM user`. MySQL rejects
 * that when the privilege was granted at database level (`ON db.*`):
 *
 *     ERROR 1147 (42000): There is no such grant defined for user 'x'
 *                         on host '%' on table 'journals'
 *
 * MySQL supports partial revokes from GLOBAL to database scope, but not from
 * database to table scope. Verified empirically on MySQL 8.4.9, not assumed.
 *
 * So the privilege is never granted at database level in the first place:
 * TenancyServiceProvider strips UPDATE and DELETE from the manager's db-level
 * grant list, and this job grants them back per-table on mutable tables only.
 * The end state is exactly what §6 intended — the estate user simply cannot
 * update or delete a journal — reached by the only route MySQL allows.
 *
 * Layer 2 is the BEFORE UPDATE / BEFORE DELETE triggers created in the tenant
 * migration. Both layers, never one: a grant is per-table and easy to lose in a
 * later migration, while a trigger survives it; conversely a trigger can be
 * dropped by anyone holding TRIGGER privilege, which the grant boundary limits.
 *
 * See DECISIONS.md D-017.
