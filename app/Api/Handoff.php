        Everything below exists, is routed from the same catalogue this was written from, and is exercised on
        every test run: `GuardApiContractTest` walks every Guard App route, `ResidentApiContractTest` every
        Resident App route, each response held to the keys its table lists. A key not in a table is a test
        failure, not a surprise.

        ## 1. Conventions

        | | |
        |---|---|
        | Base URL | `https://{platform host}/api/v1` |
        | Format | JSON in and out. Send `Accept: application/json`. Multipart only for the two media uploads. |
        | Authentication | `Authorization: Bearer {token}` on every endpoint except the four sign-in endpoints |
        | Writes | `Idempotency-Key` and `X-Device-Time` headers — see §3 |
        | Times | ISO 8601 with offset. Dates `YYYY-MM-DD`. The server answers in UTC. |
        | Money | Decimal strings, `"38450.00"`, never numbers. Currency `JMD`. |
        | Ids | Integers unless named `pass_id` (a UUID) |
        | Errors | `{"error": {"code": "snake_case", "message": "A sentence to show."}}` — §5 |

        ### The rule that shapes the Guard App

        **No endpoint a guard's token reaches returns a household's money.** A household in arrears reaches a
        handset as `access_restricted: true` and an amber verdict, and nothing else — no balance, no bucket, no
        wording that implies one. The one money a guard's handset reads is their **own** payslip. The contract
        tests scan every guard response for money-named keys and currency figures. Build the Guard App assuming
        the figure is unavailable; it is the product, not an oversight.

        ### The rule that shapes the Resident App

        **One household, the token's.** Every dues, pass, ticket and booking endpoint is keyed on the account's
        own unit; an id belonging to another household answers `404 not_found`, exactly as an id nobody has.

        ---

        ## 2. Getting a token

        ### Guard App — enrolment by code

        1. Gemini's office issues a one-time code for the guard: `php artisan device:enrolment-code GS-1041`
           (hashed at rest, 24 hours, once).
        2. The app generates an **Ed25519 key pair** on the device and keeps the secret half in the secure enclave.
        3. `POST /devices/enrol` with the code, a stable install UID, the platform and the public key.
           - A guard with no handset (or this same install): `201`, `status: enrolled`, and the token — shown once.
           - A guard already bound to a different handset: `202`, `status: pending_approval`, a
             `rebind_request_id` and a `claim_secret`. A supervisor approves on the guard's profile; the app polls
             `POST /devices/enrol/{rebind}/collect` and receives the token once. The old handset's token stops
             working at that moment, and the approval is recorded on the guard's shift.
        4. Store the token in the keychain/keystore. One guard, one working handset.

        ### Resident App — sign-in by code, then a unit claim

        1. `POST /auth/otp/request` with the estate, `email` or `sms`, and the address. The answer is identical
           whether or not an account exists. A code lasts {$ttl} minutes and {$tries} tries.
        2. `POST /auth/otp/verify` with the code and the install. The response carries the token and `next`:
           - `claim_unit` — a new account is **pending**. `POST /auth/claim-unit`.
           - `await_approval` — the estate is reviewing the claim. Poll `GET /me`.
           - `home` — the account is active.
        3. A pending token reaches `GET /me` and `POST /auth/claim-unit` and nothing else (`403 account_pending`).
           When the estate approves the claim, the account is active on its next request — no new sign-in.
        4. Text messages need an SMS provider the platform does not have yet: `sms` answers
           `503 sms_unavailable` in production. Offer email.

        ---

        ## 3. Writes: idempotency and the device clock

        **`Idempotency-Key`** — required on every write marked *write* below (the first seven endpoints accept it
        without requiring it). Choose it when the act happens, store it with the queued act, and reuse it on
        every retry until the server answers. The first answer is stored against this token and key, and every
        retry gets it back byte for byte with `Idempotent-Replayed: true`; nothing happens twice.

        | Same key and… | Answer |
        |---|---|
        | the same request | the stored response, replayed |
        | a different request | `422 idempotency_key_reused` — a bug in the app |
        | the first attempt still running | `409 request_in_progress` — retry with the same key |
        | the first attempt failed with a 5xx | nothing was stored — the retry is a real attempt |

        The ballot is the one exception to "a different request": its record keeps a hash of the method and path
        only, never the paper, so a stored hash cannot be tried against the options to learn a vote. A different
        paper under the same key is answered with the first answer.

        **`X-Device-Time`** — the handset's own clock at the moment the act happened (for a queued act, when it
        was captured, not when it was sent). Required on writes. The server never corrects it: every successful
        write answers `server_time`, `device_time` and `clock_skewed` (true beyond {$skew} seconds). Show a guard
        whose clock is wrong that it is wrong.

        ---

        ## 4. Offline

        ### Verifying a visitor pass with no signal

        A pass in a QR code is `base64url(payload) . "." . base64url(signature)`. The payload is canonical JSON
        with exactly these fields in this order: {$fields}. It names no visitor, unit or household.

        On the handset:

        1. Split at the `.`; base64url-decode both halves. Two halves, a 64-byte signature and those eight keys in
           that order — anything else is `malformed`.
        2. `site_id` must be the site the handset is posted to — else `wrong_site`. Decide this before any key.
        3. Look up the cached public key for `site_id` and `key_version` (`GET /sites/{site}/pass-keys`, refreshed
           at every sync) — none is `unknown_key`.
        4. Verify the Ed25519 detached signature **over the base64url payload segment exactly as it appears in the
           token** (the ASCII bytes, not the decoded JSON) — failure is `bad_signature`.
        5. Compare `valid_from`/`valid_to` to the handset's clock with {$tolerance} seconds' tolerance —
           `not_yet_valid` / `expired`.
        6. Otherwise the verdict is **`valid_offline`** — never `valid`. Show it as "Valid pass — not checked
           against cancellations".

        What the handset cannot know offline — a cancellation, or a single-use pass already used at another gate —
        it learns at sync: `GET /sync/pull` returns every still-unexpired pass revoked since the last pull; refuse
        those locally from then on. An admission made offline is sent as `POST /gate/entry` with
        `verified_offline: true`; the server records it and answers `reconciliation`, which the app shows the guard.

        Retired signing keys stay published for {$grace} days — the longest a pass runs — so a rotation never
        strands a pass already issued. `libsodium` (`crypto_sign_verify_detached`) or any Ed25519 implementation
        verifies it; `App\Services\Passes\OfflinePassVerifier` is the reference implementation and runs in a test
        with every database connection severed.

        ### The queue

        Capture every write offline with its Idempotency-Key and its device time, in order. When signal returns:

        1. `GET /sync/pull?since={last next_since}` — shifts, order versions, messages, pending alertness checks,
           revoked passes and current pass keys, request and claim decisions.
        2. `POST /sync/batch` with up to fifty queued operations, oldest first, each naming its endpoint by the
           catalogue name in the heading of its table below. Each runs through that endpoint exactly as if sent
           live. The batch stops at the first server failure (`failed`, then `not_attempted`) and never at a
           refusal (`refused` is an answer — show it). Resend what was not `ok` or `refused`, with the same keys.
        3. Media uploads are not batchable: send them after the report they belong to has an id.

        Panic and duress are the exception to queueing quietly: send the moment any signal exists, and prompt the
        user to call the emergency number meanwhile.

        ## 9. Where the rules live

        The apps must not reimplement any of these; the consoles call the same services.

        | Rule | Owner |
        |---|---|
        | Who may be admitted at a gate | `App\Services\Restriction\RestrictionPolicy` |
        | What a guard may learn about a household | `Household::guardVisibleStanding()` — a boolean |
        | Signing and verifying passes | `App\Services\Passes\VisitorPasses`, `OfflinePassVerifier`, `PassSigningKeys` |
        | Alerts | `App\Services\Dispatch\AlertIntake` |
        | Gate decisions | `App\Services\Dispatch\GateLog` |
        | Clocking on and off | `App\Services\Dispatch\ShiftClock` |
        | Handset enrolment | `App\Services\Devices\DeviceEnrolment` |
        | Resident sign-in and unit claims | `App\Services\ResidentApp\ResidentSignIn`, `ResidentAccounts` |
        | Dues figures | `App\Services\Estate\Dues` — the ledger |
        | The vote | `App\Services\Estate\Governance::castVote` |
        | Every endpoint's contract | `App\Api\Catalogue` |

        ## 10. Building before the apps ship

        `php artisan simulate:alerts` and `php artisan simulate:gate --shift-change` speak to this API over HTTP
        with borrowed guard handsets; every row they write is flagged `is_simulated` and badged on the consoles.
        Send `"simulated": true` only from a simulator.

        ## 11. Not here, deliberately

        | Not built | Why |
        |---|---|
        | SMS delivery | No provider chosen; `sms` answers `503 sms_unavailable` in production. Email works. |
        | Card payments and AutoPay | Dues are paid by hand (Q-012). `pay-intent` gives instructions; `autopay` refuses. |
        | Push notifications | No APNs/FCM integration. The apps poll `GET /me/household` (gate approvals), `GET /sync/pull` and `GET /messages`. |
        | Realtime sockets for handsets | The Reverb channels are console channels. Handsets poll. |
        | Biometric templates | Never leave the device. `alertness/{check}/respond` takes a 0–100 score at most. |
        | Photos of walk-up visitors | No ruling on keeping images of the public; the approval works without one. |
        | Deleting vehicles, contacts or members | Not specified by 13 D3; the estate office can. |
