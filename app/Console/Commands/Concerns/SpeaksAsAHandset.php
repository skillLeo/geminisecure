/**
 * Lets a simulator command speak to /api/v1 the way a real handset does.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Every /api/v1 endpoint is behind `auth:sanctum` and an
 * ability. `simulate:alerts` was written before that was true and never updated,
 * so it had been answering 401 on every request and reporting "Raised 0 of 5"
 * as though the simulation had merely gone badly. A simulator that cannot
 * authenticate is not simulating anything.
 *
 * IT ENROLS A REAL HANDSET AND REVOKES IT AFTERWARDS. The alternative — letting
 * the simulator bypass the middleware with `Sanctum::actingAs` — would exercise
 * the controllers and skip the two things most likely to be wrong: whether the
 * route is behind the right ability, and whether a token that lacks it is
 * refused. So the simulator enrols, speaks over the wire with a bearer token,
 * and hands the handset back.
 *
 * The guard it borrows is a real one at the estate being simulated, which also
 * means the events it writes carry a plausible guard and post rather than nulls.
