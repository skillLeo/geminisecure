 * How a real deployment bootstraps a phone. The Guard App will eventually do
 * this over an enrolment code, but somebody has to be able to issue the first
 * token from the machine that runs the platform, and an API nothing can reach
 * is an API nobody can test.
 *
 * THE TOKEN IS PRINTED ONCE AND NEVER STORED. Sanctum keeps a hash; if this
 * output is lost the handset is enrolled again, which is a thirty-second job
 * and the correct trade for not keeping a working credential in a database
 * somebody can read.
