/**
 * The money gate: the extra bar the accounting modules carry.
 *
 *     php artisan gate:ledger
 *
 * Three promises are made about this ledger, and none of them is the kind a
 * reader can check by looking:
 *
 *   1. DEBITS EQUAL CREDITS AT EVERY WRITE
 *   2. EVERY SUB-LEDGER TIES TO ITS CONTROL ACCOUNT
 *   3. A POSTED JOURNAL CANNOT BE EDITED
 *
 * An unbalanced ledger does not look unbalanced. A control account that has
 * drifted from its sub-ledger shows a plausible number on every screen it
 * appears on. An entry somebody edited looks exactly like one nobody did. So
 * each promise is PROVEN here rather than assumed, in two ways: by auditing
 * every row already posted, and by attempting the forbidden write live against
 * the real estate database and requiring it to be refused.
 *
 * The live probes matter more than the audit. An audit proves nothing was
 * broken yesterday; a probe proves it cannot be broken today. `gate:isolation`
 * takes the same position about append-only records and this follows it.
 *
 * Exits non-zero on any failure, so it belongs in CI rather than in a habit.
 *
 * Deliberately pure ASCII, for the reason GateTenantIsolation states: this file
 * is rewritten by tooling on Windows, where a UTF-8 round-trip can place a BOM
 * ahead of the strict_types declaration and break the file outright.
