/**
 * No colour is written as a hex literal outside tokens.css and a documented
 * allowlist.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `tokens.css` has said since Phase 0: "A hex literal written
 * inline in a component is a defect. Reference these tokens instead." It even
 * says of `--success-100` that it was "tokenised here so no component carries
 * the literal" — and ten components carried the literal anyway, found by looking
 * rather than by any check. The client's instruction: fix them, and "add a gate
 * that fails the build on any hex literal outside tokens.css and a documented
 * allowlist — otherwise this recurs" (D-085).
 *
 * A LITERAL THAT MATCHES A TOKEN IS STILL A DEFECT, and it is the dangerous
 * kind. It looks identical today. Change the token and every component carrying
 * the literal keeps the old colour, silently — which is the one thing a token
 * system exists to prevent.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED, AND EVERY ENTRY SAYS WHY. Each one weakens the gate, so each
 * is argued in its own words below. The lifted wireframe stylesheets are allowed
 * wholesale because they ARE the approved design, generated verbatim by
 * `tests/Fidelity/lift-stylesheets.mjs` and marked "do not edit by hand"; the
 * rest are single literals in single files, ruled on or genuinely without a
 * token.
 *
 * Like `gate:assumptions`, this proves a habit rather than a behaviour: it reads
 * files and asserts that a rule written in one of them is kept in the others.
