/**
 * Mobile event simulator: a shift's worth of gate traffic.
 *
 *   php artisan simulate:gate --count=20
 *   php artisan simulate:gate --shift-change
 *
 * Fires real events through the REAL /api/v1 endpoints the Guard App will call,
 * exactly as `simulate:alerts` does. Nothing here writes to a table directly, so
 * the endpoints, their validation, their idempotency and their clock handling
 * are exercised rather than bypassed — and nothing built against the simulator
 * has to be rewritten when the app arrives.
 *
 * WHY THE MIX IS WHAT IT IS. Roughly three in four arrivals come in on something
 * the platform issued and one in four on the guard's own judgement, because that
 * ratio is the figure `AdoptionRollup` turns into board 07's "Visitor passes"
 * bar. A simulator that admitted everybody on a QR pass would draw a perfect
 * client and teach nobody anything; one that admitted nobody on a pass would
 * make every client look like they had never adopted it. The point of the
 * screen is the middle, so the middle is what this generates.
 *
 * Every row it creates is flagged `is_simulated`, so the source badge on the web
 * screens can say plainly that the data is not real.
