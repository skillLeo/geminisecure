| The event simulator — /simulator. Part C of the web deliverable.

| Loaded by routes/web.php inside the shared auth group. Do not add `auth`
| here; do add the module's own `can:` permission to every route.
|
| REGISTERED ONLY WHILE THE FLAG IS ON. Not gated, not hidden: absent. A host
| without GS_SIMULATOR_ENABLED answers 404 for every one of these, exactly as
| it does for a URL that was never built — so a production console cannot be
| talked into firing a panic alert at a client by anybody, whatever they hold.
|
| With the flag on, it is the Director's. `platform_settings.configure` is the
| verb the matrix gives to exactly one role, and putting events into a client's
| live dispatch queue is a platform act rather than a dispatch one.
