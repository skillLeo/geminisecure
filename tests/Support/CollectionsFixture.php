/**
 * An estate to test collections against — the same fixture pattern as
 * `EstateArrearsTest`, deliberately smaller.
 *
 * A DATABASE OF ITS OWN, built once per process by the real migrations and the
 * real chart of accounts, so a payment plan is scheduled against a genuine
 * posted balance rather than a number a test wrote into a column. Every balance
 * below is raised as a CHARGE through `Dues`, which posts the entry, because
 * `Collections::schedule` reads the ledger and would find nothing otherwise.
 *
 * IT IS NOT PHOENIX PARK, and it does not try to be. The arrears suite needs
 * 450 units because the figures it proves are estate-wide totals; nothing here
 * is a total. What these tests prove is arithmetic on one unit's balance and a
 * gate decision about one household, and both are reachable with six lots — so
 * six lots is what gets built, and the suite stays fast enough to run on every
 * change to the restriction policy.
 *
 * SHARED BY TWO SUITES. `EstateCollectionsTest` and the payment-plan cases in
 * `RestrictionPolicyTest` both build on it, which is why it is a class rather
 * than a Pest helper: a global function defined in one test file and called
 * from another is a dependency on load order that nothing declares.
