| The rule for the money modules: a screen figure is not proven by rendering.
| It is proven by equalling the sum of specific posted journal lines. A
| dashboard figure that agrees with the ledger by coincidence is the defect
| that surfaces at an audit and nowhere earlier.
|
| SO EVERY EXPECTATION BELOW IS COMPUTED TWICE, BY DIFFERENT ROUTES. The
| application's figure comes through `Dues`, which reads the ledger through
| Eloquent and its own grouping. The expected figure is a raw SQL sum written
| out longhand in the test. If the two agree, the screen's number is the
| ledger's number; if the test simply called the same method it was checking,
| it would prove only that the method is deterministic.
|
| These run against the REAL Phoenix Park estate rather than a fixture, because
| the figures under test are the ones on the boards — 450 units, J$1,840,000 of
| arrears across four buckets and five phases — and a fixture with two units
| could not reach any of them. The suite reads and never writes.
