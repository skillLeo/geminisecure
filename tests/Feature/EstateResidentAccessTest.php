|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Who may open the residents screens, and who is refused
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| EVERY ROUTE IS ASSERTED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A gate that only ever returns 200
| for the role it was written for proves nothing: what makes a permission real is
| the 403, and a middleware string with a typo in it fails open silently while
| every happy-path test goes on passing. So each of the nine routes below is
| requested twice — once by a role that holds the permission and once by a role
| that does not.
|
| THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE SECRETARY ON `approve`. D-013 separated
| `approve` from `update` so that a role could prepare an irreversible act
| without being able to commit it, and approving a unit claim is exactly such an
| act: it binds a person to a household, deciding whose guest passes they may
| issue and whose gate they may be admitted at, and no edit afterwards unbinds
| the night somebody was let through. The Secretary holds Full on Residents —
| they may refuse a claim and ask for a document all day — and is refused the
| approval. If that ever returns 302 this file has caught the collapse of the
| ruling.
|
| AND `estate.residents.view` DOES NOT CARRY A BALANCE. The register is a
| different module from Dues & ledger, and D-010 locks the Property Manager out
| of the second while giving them Full on the first. `EstateResidentsTest` proves
| the payload withholds it; this file proves they can still open the screen,
| which is the other half of the same ruling — the separation is meant to narrow
| what they see, not to lock them out of their own register.
|
| A REAL ESTATE, OVER A REAL HOSTNAME. These requests go through subdomain
| tenancy exactly as production serves them, so what is under test is the whole
| stack a committee member actually meets: resolve the estate, authenticate,
| check the assignment, then check the module.
