|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| What an estate is allowed to say about itself to the platform
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Board 07 is the report that tests this platform's hardest rule: a cross-client
| screen reads gs_platform and never opens an estate database. `AdoptionRollup`
| counts the two capabilities Gemini operates; `AdoptionReport` is the other
| half, running inside each estate and pushing five more outward.
|
| That push is the only place estate data crosses the boundary on purpose, so it
| is the place to assert what may cross. Two integers and a sentence. No name, no
| household, no unit, no money — and, for governance, no way back to a voter.
