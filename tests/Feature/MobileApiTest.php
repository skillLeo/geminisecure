| /api/v1 — what a handset may do, and what it may never be told
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| INVARIANT 2 IS THIS FILE'S FIRST JOB. No endpoint reachable by a guard may
| return a monetary amount — not a balance, not an ageing bucket, not a payment
| history, not a wage. That is asserted here against the whole response body of
| every endpoint a handset holds an ability for, rather than trusted to the
| absence of a field somebody might add later.
|
| THE SECOND JOB IS THAT THE DOOR IS SHUT. Every one of these endpoints was
| unreachable by anything for weeks: they sit behind `auth:sanctum` and an
| ability, and nothing could mint a token. `simulate:alerts` had been answering
| 401 on every request and reporting it as a failed simulation. So the tests
| below check both directions — a token with the ability gets in, and one
| without is refused — because "it returns 401" and "it returns 401 for the
| right reason" are different facts.
