/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Client health, and the roll-up that lets it exist
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Board super-admin-07 is the report that tested this console's hardest rule: a
| cross-tenant report reads gs_platform and never opens an estate database.
| Adoption is recorded inside each estate, so the report waited until the owner
| of each fact could roll it up centrally. Four things are worth asserting:
|
|   1. NOTHING TO MEASURE IS NOT NOUGHT PER CENT. A client with no posts yet has
|      not failed at anything, and a bar at zero would put them at the bottom of
|      a health list for having done nothing wrong.
|
|   2. NOT REPORTED IS NOT ZERO EITHER. A capability nobody has counted has no
|      score, and the chip says so rather than guessing.
|
|   3. THE ROLL-UP COUNTS COVERAGE, NOT HEADCOUNT. A post worked by an
|      unlicensed guard, or by one with no bound handset, is not the Guard App
|      being used — it is a gate the client is paying for and not getting.
|
|   4. SCOPE NARROWS IN SQL, as everywhere else in this console.
|
| RefreshDatabase is deliberately NOT used: this suite shares gs_platform_test
| with the rest of the console and dropping the schema mid-run would take other
| tests with it. Each test runs inside a transaction and leaves nothing behind.
