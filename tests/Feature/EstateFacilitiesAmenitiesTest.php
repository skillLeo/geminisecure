/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The booking diary and the rate card behind it — boards 19 and 20
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| TWO GUARANTEES ARE UNDER TEST HERE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS SUPPORT.
|
| The first is that A BOOKING CARRIES THE TERMS IT WAS MADE UNDER. The fee, the
| deposit and the cancellation rule are copied off the amenity when the booking
| is made and never read back through the relation. A booking that read the
| amenity live would restate every held deposit in the estate the moment a
| manager typed a new figure into board 20 — and the estate would then owe
| residents an amount its own books no longer showed. So the rate card is edited
| below, under a deposit the estate is already holding, and the deposit must not
| move by one cent.
|
| The second is that AN AMENITY FEE IS MONEY, and money is proven by lines. Not
| "the number renders": the J$3,000 on board 19 equals the debit posted to 1200
| Dues Receivable, equals the credit posted to 4100 Amenity Booking Fees, equals
| the movement in that unit's own sub-ledger. Each of those is summed here in raw
| SQL written out longhand, so the expectation and the application reach the same
| figure by two different routes — and the entry behind them is then attacked
| live, inside rolled-back transactions, the way `gate:ledger` attacks the real
| estate. An audit proves nothing was broken yesterday; a probe proves it cannot
| be broken today.
|
| AND THE PERSONA THE BOARD IS DRAWN FOR MAY NOT DO IT. Board 19 names "record a
| fee" among the Property Manager's actions; recording it posts a charge against
| a unit, which is `estate.dues_ledger.create`, which D-010 locks that role out
| of entirely. The invariant outranks the board, and the assertion below is an
| HTTP 403 rather than a greyed button.
