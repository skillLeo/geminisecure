|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| An alert reaches one estate's console and no other
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| The alert feed is the one place where a single mistake fans a record out to
| every connected client at once. Two things have to hold:
|
|   1. the channel is PRIVATE, so subscription goes through authorization at
|      all. It was briefly a public Channel, which meant the per-estate
|      boundary its own docblock described did not exist — a public channel is
|      subscribable by anyone who can guess its name, and the names are estate
|      subdomains.
|
|   2. the authorization callback admits exactly the right people.
|
| Testing (1) without (2) proves nothing, and vice versa.
