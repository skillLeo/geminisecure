/**
 * Arrears restriction (D-024, D-025).
 *
 * These assertions are the reason the policy exists in one class. The
 * exemptions in particular must fail loudly if anyone ever edits them: a
 * misconfigured estate leaving an ambulance at a gate is not recoverable, so
 * the guarantee cannot rest on review.
 *
 * THE FIRST SECTION TOUCHES NO DATABASE, and that is deliberate. Every
 * household in it is constructed in memory, so the exemptions are proven on the
 * policy's own logic with nothing behind it that could be misconfigured into
 * making them pass. The payment-plan section below needs a real estate, because
 * a plan is a real row a real query has to find — but the two are kept apart so
 * the ambulance assertions can never come to depend on a fixture.
