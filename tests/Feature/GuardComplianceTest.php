/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The un-rosterable state, and the open compliance case
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Boards super-admin-19 and super-admin-23 are the SAME profile screen drawn on
| two guards. The second one is not a styling variant: Devon Palmer's PSRA
| licence has lapsed, so his record is in two states a compliant guard's is not.
|
| The Build Spec is unambiguous about the first — "Expired licence sets
| un-rosterable: a hard block, not a warning" — and the failure mode it guards
| against is silent. A screen that quietly kept offering to reassign an
| unlicensed officer would look completely normal, and would be helping someone
| post a guard who cannot legally stand a gate. So the block is asserted here,
| not left to be seen.
|
| RefreshDatabase is deliberately NOT used: this suite shares gs_platform_test
| with the rest of the console and dropping the schema mid-run would take other
| tests with it. Each test runs inside a transaction and leaves nothing behind.
