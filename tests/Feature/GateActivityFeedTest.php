/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The cross-client activity feed, and the three tables it reads
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Board super-admin-26 shows what every gate is reporting, across every client.
| It is the screen with the strongest architectural constraint on it, and three
| things about it are worth asserting:
|
|   1. IT READS THREE TABLES AND MERGES THEM. A gate decision has no central
|      home, so `gate_events` holds it. A checkpoint scan and a shift start
|      already have one. Copying those into a fourth table so this could be a
|      single query would create two records of one event that are free to
|      disagree — and the one that disagrees is the one an insurer reads.
|
|   2. NOTHING HERE OPENS AN ESTATE DATABASE. A cross-client feed built by
|      querying each estate in turn would be an isolation breach wearing a
|      report's clothes, and it would look identical on the screen.
|
|   3. "GUARDS ON POST" MEANS STANDING ONE. Counting standing assignments would
|      include a guard whose licence has lapsed and who is therefore not
|      rostered anywhere — while the coverage board two screens away reports
|      their gate as uncovered.
|
| RefreshDatabase is deliberately NOT used: this suite shares gs_platform_test
| with the rest of the console and dropping the schema mid-run would take other
| tests with it. Each test runs inside a transaction and leaves nothing behind.
