/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The Estate Console sidebar, asserted against the matrix rather than a board
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| THE BOARDS CANNOT BE THE AUTHORITY HERE, and one test settles it: board 05's
| persona is the PROPERTY MANAGER, and its sidebar draws Dues & ledger,
| Accounting and Payroll & HR — the three modules Ruling 1 locks that role out
| of. Every estate board draws the same ten items whatever persona it names, so
| the sidebar on those boards is an illustration and belongs to no role.
|
| The Build Spec is explicit about what does govern it: "This matrix generates
| navigation. A role without a module permission does not see that module at
| all." So the pixel harness measures the CONTENT region of an estate board, and
| the sidebar is proven here instead — against the permission matrix, which is
| the thing it is actually generated from.
|
| The Property Manager case is the one that matters. A sidebar that showed them
| Dues & ledger would be the console handing a resident's financial position to
| the person who commissions the work, which is a locked platform invariant and
| not an estate setting. D-010, D-044.
