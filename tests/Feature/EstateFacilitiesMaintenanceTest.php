|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The maintenance queue — boards 17 and 18
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| ONE GUARANTEE IS UNDER TEST HERE AND EVERYTHING ELSE SUPPORTS IT: the SLA
| clock starts at the report and nothing an estate does afterwards moves it.
|
| That is easy to say and easy to lose. `assigned_at` is right there on the row,
| a queue built the obvious way would measure from it, and the ticket that had
| been ignored longest would then be the one the screen reported as fine. Ticket
| #1041 is seeded to make the failure visible: six days old against a one-day
| target, with a vendor named six hours after the report. It is overdue, it is
| still overdue the moment a different vendor is named, and its STORED status
| says `assigned` throughout — because "overdue" is not a state anybody sets. It
| is arithmetic over two columns of one row, computed at draw time.
|
| THE FOUR TILES ARE THE SAME ARITHMETIC, TOTALLED. 12 open, 7 in progress, 2
| overdue and 3.2 days average resolution are not four numbers this seeder wrote
| down: they are counts and a mean over seventeen tickets, and every one of them
| is re-derived below in raw SQL so that the expectation and the application
| reach the same figure by two different routes.
|
| THE FIRST TEST IN THIS FILE COUNTS THE WHOLE QUEUE, so it runs before anything
| here raises a ticket of its own. Every test after it either works on a ticket
| it created or, where board 17's own rows are the point, leaves the counts
| alone.
