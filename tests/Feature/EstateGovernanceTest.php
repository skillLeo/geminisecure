/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The two governance rules nobody had asked the client about
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE IT DID NOT. Governance is one of the four hard-stop
| categories in QUESTIONS.md — money, restriction, biometrics, voting — and it
| carried two live assumptions, Q-010 (statutory notice periods) and Q-011
| (candidate tenure), with no test file of any kind behind them. Both were found
| by auditing the `// ASSUMPTION Q-0xx` markers in the source against the
| question queue, and neither was in the queue either. See D-074.
|
| WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THE ASSUMPTION, NOT THE ANSWER. Nobody has ruled on either
| figure. So these tests pin what the platform does TODAY and, for each, the
| direction the default errs in — because that is the part a ruling changes and
| the part somebody has to be able to see before they change it.
|
| Q-010 · notice is ENFORCED by default and the AGM period is the LONGER of the
| two Jamaican readings, 21 days rather than 14. The asymmetry is the whole
| decision: refusing a meeting that could lawfully have been called costs the
| estate a week, and publishing one that could not costs it the meeting and every
| decision taken at it.
|
| Q-011 · tenure is NOT enforced by default and the threshold is zero. The harm
| runs one way here: an invented tenure rule disqualifies a member from standing
| for office in their own community, and no ballot can be un-closed.
|
| A ruling either way lands in this file, on the expectations rather than on the
| structure.

/**
 * A unit that owes nothing, found rather than named.
 *
 * THE TENURE TESTS BELOW MUST NOT BE ABLE TO PASS FOR THE WRONG REASON, and
 * naming a lot was how they first did. `eligibility()` checks arrears BEFORE
 * tenure and returns the first refusal it finds, so a unit in arrears comes back
 * ineligible whatever its tenure — and these tests were reading "not eligible"
 * as the tenure rule biting when it was the arrears rule.
 *
 * The estate database is built once per process and is NOT rolled back between
 * tests; only the platform connection is. `EstateFacilitiesAmenitiesTest` posts
 * J$18,600 of 120-day arrears against Lot 3 to exercise the amenity block, and
 * leaves it there. Run alone this file was green; run after that one, three
 * tests failed — which is the good version of this bug, because the suite ran
 * both ways.
 *
 * So the unit is chosen at runtime by the condition that matters, and the
 * precondition is asserted rather than assumed. A future test that charges every
 * unit in the estate gets a named failure instead of a silent wrong pass.
