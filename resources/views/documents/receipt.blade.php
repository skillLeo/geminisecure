{{--
    The receipt a resident keeps.

    THE RECEIPT NUMBER IS THE DOCUMENT. It came from the estate's own sequence
    when the payment posted — never reused, gaps recorded — so this piece of
    paper and the row in the register are the same fact, and either can be found
    from the other.

        This receipt records one payment. It is not a statement of the account, and the balance may have moved since —
        a statement of account can be issued from the estate office.
