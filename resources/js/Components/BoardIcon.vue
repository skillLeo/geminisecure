/**
 * Icons the boards use OUTSIDE the sidebar.
 *
 * Separate from ModuleIcon on purpose. The boards draw the same subjects with
 * different geometry and different stroke weights depending on where they sit,
 * and those differences are deliberate:
 *
 *   sidebar navigation   1.8   ModuleIcon
 *   KPI cards            1.7   here
 *   activity rows        1.6   here
 *
 * The people icon also differs: the sidebar's has a second figure behind the
 * first, the KPI and activity ones do not. Folding these together behind one
 * component and normalising the stroke is exactly the kind of tidying that
 * produced the drift these boards are being re-lifted to fix.
 *
 * Stroke is a prop rather than baked in, because the same path is drawn at 1.7
 * in a KPI card and 1.6 in an activity row on the same screen.
 *
 * An unknown name renders nothing rather than a fallback glyph. A missing icon
 * is a visible bug worth fixing; a generic placeholder silently ships
 * something nobody drew.
