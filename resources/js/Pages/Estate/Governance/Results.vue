/**
 * The tally, and the one act that makes it final — board community-admin-11.
 *
 * NOTHING ON THIS SCREEN CAN BE USED TO LEARN HOW A NAMED HOUSEHOLD VOTED, and
 * that is a schema guarantee before it is a screen one. `ballot_receipts`
 * records THAT a household voted and `ballot_marks` records WHAT was chosen;
 * the two share no column, there is no query that could join them, and
 * `Governance` has no method that would answer the question. Everything drawn
 * here is an aggregate:
 *
 *   turnout    COUNT(*) over the receipts against a snapshotted denominator
 *   phases     the same count grouped by the PROPERTY's phase, never by unit
 *   the cards  COUNT(*) over the marks per option
 *
 * The finest grain anything on this screen reaches is board 11's own headline,
 * "318 of 450 households (71%)" — a numerator, a denominator and a percentage.
 * There is no roll, no list of who has voted, no per-household tick, and no
 * ordering anywhere that could be correlated with one. There is also no control
 * that casts a vote and no route that could back one: voting is a resident act
 * in the resident app, and this console runs the election without ever marking
 * a paper.
 *
 * THE SHARES ARE OF BALLOTS CAST, NOT OF VOTES CAST, and board 11 is drawn that
 * way deliberately: in a three-seat race one voter marks three names, so the
 * shares sum to more than 100 and are supposed to. 187 and 131 happen to sum to
 * 318 because Chairman is a single seat, which is what makes the two readings
 * look identical on the Chairman card and different on the one beside it.
 * Dividing by total votes would make a three-seat race look like a three-way
 * split of one.
 *
 * CERTIFICATION IS IRREVERSIBLE AND THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT UNDOES IT. The
 * Build Spec: "a certified ballot cannot be reopened or edited". There is no
 * decertify method in the service, no route, and no control on this page — a
 * certified result that turns out to be wrong is put right by running another
 * ballot, exactly as a posted journal is corrected by another entry. Once the
 * ballot is certified this screen prints the certificate and offers nothing.
 *
 * AND IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S ACT, NOT THE SECRETARY'S. The estate matrix gives
 * Governance `Full · Approver` to the President and Vice President and plain
 * `Full` to the Secretary, so the officer who RUNS the election is deliberately
 * not the officer who declares it final — D-013. The banner's own copy
 * addresses the Returning Officer, which is a description of who reviews the
 * tally rather than of who holds the permission; a Secretary reading this
 * screen sees the button inert with that distinction on it rather than a
 * permission error.

 * declare a face and no border, which is why those three are safe to reset.
 *
 * `.btn-outline-sm` IS NOT RESET. It carries `border:1.5px solid
 * var(--navy-200)` on every board and a scoped element selector would
 * out-specify that and rub the outline off the control entirely — a real
 * difference from the approved design, small enough to survive a passing
