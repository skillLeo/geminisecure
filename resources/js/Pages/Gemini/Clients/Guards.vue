/**
 * Manage guard assignment — board screen super-admin-10.
 *
 * THE ROSTER IS STAGED, THEN SAVED, and that is the board's design rather than
 * a convenience. It draws "Save changes" in the topbar, and the Build Spec
 * lists "save the roster" as an action beside assign, unassign and reassign.
 * Moving one officer off the Service Gate and another onto it is a single
 * decision about one estate's cover; committed row by row it would pass through
 * a state where the gate reads as unmanned, and the dispatch coverage board
 * reads that same record. So every control here edits a local roster and
 * nothing reaches the database until Save is pressed.
 *
 * Four controls, all live, one per action the spec names:
 *
 *   ×                     unassign. Takes the row off the staged roster.
 *   pencil                reassign. Turns the row's post into a picker of THIS
 *                         estate's posts — never another client's.
 *   the add row           assign. A real <select> of the workforce pool, which
 *                         is drawn as the board's own row rather than as a
 *                         field, because the board draws a row.
 *   Save changes          commits the lot, in one transaction, audited.
 *
 * THE LAPSED LICENCE IS BLOCKED BY ABSENCE. The picker never lists an officer
 * whose PSRA licence has expired — the spec is explicit that it blocks rather
 * than warns — and the service refuses one anyway, because a list is a courtesy
 * and the rule has to hold against a request made by hand.
 *
 * Devon Palmer is the case that shows the difference. He is on this roster with
 * an expired licence and he stays on it: D-034 keeps an officer visible to the
 * client whose gate they are standing, and clearing him here would tidy this
 * screen while the problem stood at Phoenix Park's service gate. He can be
 * removed. He cannot be re-added.
 *
 * DOM and class names are the board's, including the two inline styles it
 * carries — the fill pill and the panel that holds the rows. Neither has a class
 * in the board's stylesheet, and inventing one would be authoring CSS the design
 * does not have.
