/**
 * Subscription plans — board screen super-admin-34.
 *
 * The rate card: what each tier costs, who is on it, and what it is sold as.
 *
 * TWO VOCABULARIES, KEPT APART. The three lines under each price are
 * `highlights` — what a tier is SOLD as, in the customer's words. What a tier
 * CONTAINS is `plan_features`, the toggle grid on the package builder that the
 * runtime resolves an estate's feature set from. Deriving one from the other
 * would put toggle keys on a pricing card, or marketing copy into the table
 * the platform runs on.
 *
 * The client line under each price is counted from live subscriptions, so a
 * client moving tier moves between cards without anyone editing a number.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES. Changing a tier price re-prices every estate on it from
 * an effective date; that belongs to the package builder's approval path, not
 * to the screen that displays the rate card.
