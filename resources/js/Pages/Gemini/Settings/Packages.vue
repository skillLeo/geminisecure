/**
 * Subscription package builder — board screen super-admin-43.
 *
 * THE TEMPLATE, NOT A CLIENT. The warning banner the board draws is the whole
 * point of the screen: a row here changes what every current and future client
 * on that tier receives. One client's exceptions are screen 44, and the banner
 * says so in the board's own words.
 *
 * Three kinds of cell, and the difference between two of them matters:
 *
 *   locked  a core feature. In every package, and no package may drop it, so it
 *           is drawn as a FACT rather than as a setting that happens to be on.
 *           Rendering it as an ordinary tick would invite someone to reach for
 *           a switch that must not exist.
 *   on/off  a real per-tier inclusion
 *   value   a tier-graded value ("Logo only", "Full theme") rather than a yes
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES. The save control is inert and says why: repricing what a
 * tier includes is a privileged, audited write with an effective date, and it
 * does not get built as a side effect of the screen that displays it.
 *
 * The board's table is drawn at 1440x1140. The emphasis on the top tier's
 * column comes from the plan ordering, not from the name "Premium", so renaming
 * or adding a tier above it moves the emphasis with it.
