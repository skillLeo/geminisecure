/**
 * Compliance action — board screen super-admin-21.
 *
 * The profile (19 and 23) SHOWS an open compliance case. This screen is where
 * it is acted on, and the difference matters: everything here either changes
 * the record or says plainly why it cannot.
 *
 * DOM, classes and label text are the board's, including the two inline grid
 * and flex styles, which are the board's own and stay inline rather than being
 * promoted to classes the design does not define.
 *
 * Four controls, and only one of them is live — which is the honest count
 * rather than a shortfall:
 *
 *   Suspend from active duty   REAL. A POST behind `guard_workforce.update`
 *                              that writes the guard's status and appends to
 *                              the audit log. The single destructive act on
 *                              this board, and the one it exists for.
 *
 *   Contact about renewal      REAL. A tel: or mailto: link built from the
 *                              record, so it dials the number on file rather
 *                              than a number somebody typed onto a board.
 *
 *   Post open shifts to cover  There is no shift roster yet. Disabled, saying
 *                              so, rather than a button that looks live.
 *
 *   Mark licence renewed       A renewal is a NEW EXPIRY DATE read off the
 *                              renewed certificate, not a flag. The same
 *                              refusal, in the same words, as the profile.
 *
 * D-034 governs what suspension does NOT do. The guard keeps their post and
 * their estate, so Phoenix Park Village 1 goes on seeing that the officer at
 * their Service Gate is the one who cannot legally stand it. Deployed means
 * posted at the estate, not compliant, and clearing the posting here would tidy
 * the client's screen while the problem stood at their gate.

 * ago, and it must say so rather than draw an action panel over nothing.
 *
 * `empty-filtered` cannot happen. One guard, one matter, no query — there is no
