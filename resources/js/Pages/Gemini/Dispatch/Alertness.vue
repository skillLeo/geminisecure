 * Guard alertness & patrol monitoring — board screen super-admin-15.

 * DOM and class names are the board's. The board draws the section tabs, the
 * banner's button and the whole table as <div>s; the tabs and the button are
 * real controls here because they navigate, and the table is a real <table>
 * because it is one.
 *
 * SILENCE IS THE FINDING. Every figure on this screen is an argument about
 * elapsed time — how long since this guard last proved they were awake — so a
 * screen that has quietly stopped refreshing is not a stale screen, it is a
 * screen that is actively lying about how long the silence has run. That is why
 * the poll and the socket both run below, and why the topbar control says which
 * of them is working.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A POSITION. The tour dots are an ordered count of fixed,
 * named checkpoints reached; there is no coordinate in any prop on this page,
 * because PatrolMonitor deliberately holds none.
