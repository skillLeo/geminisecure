 * once that window has begun, somebody actually clocked in. A standing
 * assignment is not coverage — it carries no time at all, and reading it as
 * "manned tonight" is the one mistake this screen exists to prevent.
 *
 * There is nothing to poll here. A roster changes when a supervisor changes it,
 * and a table nobody is watching for movement does not need a refresh loop.
