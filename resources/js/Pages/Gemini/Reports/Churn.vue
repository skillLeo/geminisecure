/**
 * Churn and retention — board screen super-admin-39.
 *
 * CHURN IS MEASURED ON CANCELLED SUBSCRIPTIONS, not on estate status. An
 * estate suspended for non-payment has not left — it is being chased — and
 * counting it as churn would make a collections problem look like a retention
 * one, which are two different conversations with two different people.
 *
 * THE EMPTY PANEL IS THE FINDING. When nothing has ever been cancelled the
 * board draws a filled empty-state under the tenure list saying so, and that
 * is the report rather than a missing section. It is replaced by real rows the
 * first time a client leaves.
 *
 * This board draws no Export control, so none is rendered — not even a
 * disabled one. Adding a control the design does not have is the opposite of
 * reproducing it.
