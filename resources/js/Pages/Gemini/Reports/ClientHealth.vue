/**
 * Client health — board screen super-admin-07.
 *
 * One card per client, a bar per capability, and a chip saying whether they are
 * getting what they pay for.
 *
 * EVERY BAR IS TWO INTEGERS, NOT A SCORE. The hover says what was counted — "2
 * of 4 active posts worked in the last 7 days by a licensed guard on a bound
 * handset" — because a bar at 50% with nothing behind it is a number an account
 * manager cannot act on or defend in a renewal conversation.
 *
 * A CAPABILITY WITH NO BAR IS NAMED, NOT DROPPED. Two different things put it
 * there: nobody has counted it yet, or the client has nothing to count. Both are
 * stated in words under the bars, because a missing bar and a bar at zero look
 * the same on a chart and mean opposite things.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE READS AN ESTATE DATABASE. The figures come from the central
 * roll-up each side writes for the capabilities it owns; the note at the foot
 * says which capabilities are still waiting on their owner and why.
