/**
 * Cross-tenant reports — board screen super-admin-36.
 *
 * A launcher, not a report. The board draws two labelled groups of three cards,
 * each card an icon, a name, a description and an Open action, and nothing else
 * on the screen; there is no chart, no date range and no export here, so none
 * is invented. Those belong to the report screens the cards open.
 *
 * The board draws the Open action as a <div>. Here it is a real control: a Link
 * where the report exists, and a disabled <button> carrying the reason where it
 * does not. Which of the two each card gets is decided on the server, from the
 * router and the viewer's permissions — see CrossTenantReports.
