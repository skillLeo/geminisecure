/**
 * Guard utilization — board screen super-admin-40.
 *
 * THE GAP IS THE REPORT. Contracted comes from the subscription, deployed from
 * the guards table, and a client paying for four guards but staffed by three
 * is an unfilled contract that is invisible from either number alone. That is
 * the only reason this screen exists.
 *
 * A guard on leave or suspended counts as NOT on active duty. A post nobody is
 * standing is unstaffed whatever the reason, and a fill rate that counted
 * absent guards would report a gate as covered while it is empty.
 *
 * Two cases the board words differently, and both are real states rather than
 * degenerate ones: a client managing their own security contracts nothing, and
 * a client mid-onboarding has contracted guards who have not started. Neither
 * is a zero to be shown as a failure.
