/**
 * Sign in — board screens super-admin-01 AND community-admin-01.
 *
 * This page wears the board class itself rather than going through
 * GeminiConsole: the sign-in screen has no sidebar and no topbar, so it is not
 * a console page, it is the door to one.
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT FOR BOTH DOORS. The two boards draw the same card with four
 * different strings and one extra row, and `LoginController::door()` is where
 * that difference lives — see its docblock for why this is not two files. Everything this component does that matters to security is therefore
 * written once: the single generic error, the absence of any registration
 * affordance, and no "remember me".
 *
 * WHICH BOARD'S STYLESHEET IT WEARS FOLLOWS THE CONSOLE, because the two cards
 * are drawn in different sheets and neither defines the other's classes. Board
 * 38 spent a whole measurement at 29% wearing a sheet that defined none of its
 * classes; a page that picks its sheet from a prop cannot make that mistake
 * silently, because the prop is the same one that picked the words.
 *
 * The card's DOM, classes and label text are the board's. Three things the
 * board draws as static decoration are real controls here — the two fields and
 * the submit button — and the only CSS in this file takes the browser's
 * default styling for those controls back off so the board's own .l-input and
 * .l-btn rules are what is seen.
 *
 * The board draws no "create account" link, which matches the platform: there
 * is no registration route anywhere in this application and there must never
 * be one. Accounts are issued by invitation.
 */

     * than to this prop. Every interpolation renders empty and nothing throws:
